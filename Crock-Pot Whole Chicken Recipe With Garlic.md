# Slow Cooker Whole Chicken Recipe With Garlic Herb Butter

## Ingredients

4 sprigs Fresh rosemary (divided)
12 sprigs Fresh thyme (divided)
100g Butter (softened)
1 head Garlic (4 cloves minced, remaining ones peeled and whole)
2 tsp Fresh parsley (chopped)
2 tsp Sea salt
1/2 tsp Paprika
1/2 tsp Black pepper
1 5-lb Whole chicken
1 large Yellow onion (cut into large, thick slices)

## Method

1. Remove the leaves from half the rosemary (2 sprigs) and half the thyme (6 sprigs). (Set the remaining whole sprigs aside.) Chop the rosemary finely.
2. In a small bowl, mash together the butter, 4 cloves minced garlic, chopped rosemary, chopped thyme, chopped parsley, salt, paprika, and pepper. Set aside.
3. Use paper towels to pat the chicken VERY dry inside and out, so that the herb butter sticks better. (For food safety reasons, it's better NOT to rinse it.)
4. Grease the bottom of the Slow Cooker with more butter. Place the onion pieces inside. (The onion will help keep the chicken raised.) Place the whole chicken, breast side up, on top of the onions.
5. Starting from the cavity side of the chicken, gently insert your hands underneath the skin to separate the skin from the meat, including the breast, thighs and legs. Be careful not to tear the skin it.
6. Use your hands to rub half the garlic herb butter all over underneath the skin. Rub the remaining butter all over the top and sides of the chicken. (If your butter is not super soft, first soften it by placing it into a small bowl over a second bowl of warm water. Very soft butter will be easier to spread!)
7. Stuff the remaining whole garlic cloves (6-10 cloves), remaining 2 whole rosemary sprigs, and remaining 6 whole thyme sprigs inside the chicken cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. If necessary, reposition the chicken and onions so that the chicken is sitting on top and the onions are elevating the chicken.
8. Cover the Crock-Pot slow cooker and cook for 3-5 hours on High.
9. If your garlic butter didn't spread well in the beginning, you can lift the lid about an hour into cooking and use a pastry brush to spread the herb butter more evenly over the top and sides of the chicken.
10. When the chicken is done, discard the onions but save the liquid below, which you can use as chicken broth in recipes!
11. Toward the end, preheat the broiler and place the rack close to it, with just enough room for the chicken to fit underneath.
12. Transfer the chicken to a baking dish or roasting pan and broil for 4-6 minutes, until browned.
13. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes on a platter before carving.
