# Soup - Simple Egg Drop Soup

## ingredients

- 450ml cups bone broth
- 1 large egg
- Fish sauce
- Salt
- 1 spring onion (thinly sliced - optional)
- 2 tbsp coriander leaves (optional)
- Hot chili peppers thinly sliced (optional)

## steps

1. In a small saucepan, bring your bone broth to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.
2. Flavor it with fish sauce and/or salt to taste.
3. Crack the egg in a small bowl and season with a few additional drops of fish sauce and a pinch of salt. Whisk well with a fork.
4. Remove the bone broth from the heat and stir the soup with a heat-proof spatula as you slowly pour in the whisked egg. The egg should cook on contact with the hot liquid even though youâ€™ve removed the saucepan from the heat. The eggs should be soft and wispy rather than overcooked and chunky.
5. Transfer the soup to a bowl.

## notes

- The soup tastes delicious as-is, but you can fancy it up with your favorite add-ins. My favorite garnishes include sliced spicy peppers, minced spring onions, and coriander leaves.
