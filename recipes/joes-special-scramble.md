## ingredients

- 10 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 2 tablespoons ghee, avocado oil, or favorite high temperature cooking fat
- 1 small onion finely chopped
- 225g mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves minced
- 225g minced beef
- 140g baby spinach

## steps

1. Heat a 12" cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. While the pan is heating up, crack the eggs in a medium bowl.
2. Whisk the eggs with the water, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Set aside.
3. When the skillet is nice and hot, add the ghee. Once it’s shimmering, toss in the onions and mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.
4. Cook, uncovered, until mushrooms release their liquid.
5. Stir-fry for another 5 minutes, or until the mushroom liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are browned.
6. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
7. Toss the minced beef in the pan and use a spatula to break up the meat.
8. Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and cook until the meat is no longer pink.
9. Add the spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is just wilted. Taste the filling to check that it’s seasoned enough and adjust if needed.
10. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Stir and scrape the pan ’til the eggs are fully set, about 3 to 5 minutes.
