## ingredients

- 1 kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 3 tbsp honey
- 3 garlic cloves minced
- 1/2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger (or 1/8 tsp ground ginger)
- 3 tbsp freshly squeezed orange juice
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon olive oil and more for greasing the sheet pan
- 2 tsp lime zest
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 3 tbsp full-fat coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon arrowroot powder
- 450 g asparagus (tough ends trimmed, spears cut in half)
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds (optional)
- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro leaves (optional)

## steps

1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and cut into 1 1/2 to 2-inch pieces.
2. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper on the chicken and toss well to distribute seasoning.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, orange juice, sesame oil, olive oil, lime zest and juice, coconut milk, and arrowroot powder.
4. Drop in the chicken pieces and toss to coat with the marinade. Marinate the chicken at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.
5. Heat the grill on high and arrange a rack 15cm from the heat source.
6. Lightly grease a sheet pan with some olive oil. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken onto the sheet pan in a single layer on one side of the pan.
7. Place the asparagus on the other side of the pan. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper on the asparagus.
8. Pour the marinade all over the chicken and asparagus.
9. Pop the tray under the broiler and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring at the halfway point. The sheet pan is ready when the chicken is cooked through, the asparagus is nicely browned, and the sauce has thickened slightly.
10. Garnish with sesame seeds and cilantro if desired and serve with cauliflower rice.
