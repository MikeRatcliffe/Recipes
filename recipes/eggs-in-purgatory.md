# Eggs in Purgatory

## ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 80 g onion (finely diced)
- 120 g mushrooms (thinly sliced)
- Magic Mushroom Powder or salt
- 1 pound sausages
- 500 ml tomato sauce
- 1 tsp crushed chillies
- 4 large eggs
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 200C with the rack in the upper-middle position.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and swirl in the extra virgin olive oil or fat of choice when the pan is hot.
3. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Toss in the mushrooms and add 1/2 tsp Magic Mushroom Powder or salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the moisture released by the mushrooms evaporates.
5. Add the sausage to the pan, breaking it up with a spatula. Cook the sausage until itâ€™s no longer pink.
6. Pour the tomato sauce into the pan and stir in the crushed chillies. Continue cooking the meaty sauce until it starts bubbling.
7. Put the sauce in a casserole dish.
8. Use a spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each one. Sprinkle Magic Mushroom Powder (or salt and black pepper) on top of the eggs.
9. Place the ramekins on the rimmed baking sheet into the hot oven. Bake until the egg whites are cooked through and the yolks are your desired consistency, about 10 to 15 minutes.
