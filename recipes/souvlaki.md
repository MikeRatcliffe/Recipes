# Souvlaki

## ingredients

- 120 ml fresh lemon juice
- 180 ml extra virgin olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1.5 kg boneless pork loin or shoulder, leg of lamb or skinless chicken thighs (cut into 1.5" cubes)
- 1 medium red onion (cut into 1.5" cubes)
- Ghee or fat of choice

## steps

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper.
2. Add the meat and coat well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 20 minutes or up to 12 hours.
3. Heat your grill to medium. In the meantime divide your meat around 8 skewers, with the onions threaded between each chunk of meat.
4. Brush some melted fat on the grill grates and then put the skewers on.
5. Cook the skewers for 3-5 minutes on each of the 4 sides or until the onions are softened or the meat is cooked.
