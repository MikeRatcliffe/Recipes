## steps

1. In a large bowl, toss the chicken thighs with pepper and 2 teaspoons of salt.

4. Add the drained tomatoes and apple cider vinegar, and pour in the broth.

6. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the thighs are cooked through.
7. transfer the cooked thighs to a plate and set it aside. Crank the stove up to high and bring the sauce to a boil.
8. While the sauce is cooking, shred the chicken thighs.
9. Once the sauce reduces by half (which takes about 10 minutes) turn off the heat and fish out the bay leaves.
10. With an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper if necessary.
11. Add the chicken back into the pot and stir to combine.
12. Serve the tinga in lettuce wraps or grain-free tortillas.
