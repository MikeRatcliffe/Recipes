## ingredients

- 60 ml avocado oil or olive oil
- 3 tbsp fresh lime juice
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 600g boneless skinless chicken thighs (cut into 1-inch strips)
- 1 medium red bell pepper (deseeded, cored and sliced into 1/4-inch strips)
- 1 medium yellow bell pepper (deseeded, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch strips)
- 1 small white onion (sliced into 1/4-inch pieces)
- 2 limes cut into wedges
- Green or butter lettuce leaves (optional)
- Grain-free tortillas (optional)
- Avocado Crema see recipe below

Avocado Crema:

- 1 large Hass avocado
- 1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk
- 1/4 cup chives roughly (chopped)
- 2 tbsp coriander (roughly chopped)
- 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## steps

1. Heat your oven to 230C with the rack in the middle. Place a stainless steel wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the avocado oil, lime juice, minced garlic, kosher salt, chili powder, and cumin.
3. Add the chicken thigh strips to the marinade. Toss in the sliced peppers and onions, too. Use your hands to combine well.
4. Plop the chicken and veggies onto the rimmed baking sheet and spread everything in a single layer.
5. Place the tray in the oven and cook for 10 minutes. Then, toss the chicken and veggies, and rotate the tray.
6. Switch to broil and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the peppers and onions are browned in places. Keep your eyes on the fajitas to make sure nothing burns!
7. While the chicken is cooking, make the Avocado Crema. Cut the avocado in half lengthwise and remove the seed. Scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender. Add the coconut milk, chives, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper.
8. Blitz until smooth. Add some water to thin out the sauce if desired. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed with salt, pepper, or more lime juice. You can refrigerate the crema in a sealed container for up to 2 days.
9. Once the chicken and veggies are finished cooking, pull the tray out of the oven. Serve the fajitas with lime wedges, lettuce wraps or grain-free tortillas, and avocado crema.
