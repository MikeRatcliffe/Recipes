# Salsa Ahumada

## ingredients

- 2 tablespoons avocado oil or ghee
- 3 medium garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 small yellow onion, roughly chopped
- 6 chillies, chopped
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## steps

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once it's sizzling hot, add the garlic and onions.
2. Cook the garlic and onions for about 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned in parts and aromatic.
3. Toss in the chillies. Cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes.
4. Add the vinegar and diced tomatoes with their juices, and bring the contents to a boil.
5. Lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatoes begin to break down (about 8-10 minutes).
6. Turn off the stove, and transfer the contents of the skillet to a blender.
7. Add the salt to the blender.
8. Puree everything until smooth. Pause to scrape down the sides of the blender if necessary. Taste the salsa and adjust with more salt if needed.
