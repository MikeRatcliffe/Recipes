![Stir Fry - Grated Brussels Sprouts With Bacon](https://recipes.ratcliffefamily.org/images/stir-fry-—-grated-brussels-sprouts-with-bacon.jpg)

## ingredients

- 4 slices bacon cut into 1/4" pieces
- 680g Brussels sprouts
- 1 large shallot thinly sliced
- 3/4 teaspoon Magic Mushroom Powder or salt
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or sherry vinegar
- 2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley and/or chives

## steps

1. Toss the bacon bits into a cold 12" (30cm) skillet and crank the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon bits are crispy.
2. While the bacon is crisping in the pan, shred the Brussels sprouts using the slicing blade of a food processor.
3. Check on the bacon. Once it’s crispy, use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon bits to a platter.
4. Dump the shallots in the pan with the bacon grease and sauté until they’re soft and browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Add the shaved Brussels sprouts and season with the Magic Mushroom Powder or salt. (If you’re using Morton’s kosher salt or a fine grain salt, only use 3/4 teaspoons.)
6. Stir-fry until the Brussels sprouts are tender, about 5 minutes.
7. Turn off the heat and add the apple cider vinegar. Taste the Brussels sprouts, and adjust the seasoning with additional Magic Mushroom Powder, salt, pepper, or vinegar.
8. Sprinkle on the reserved bacon bits.
