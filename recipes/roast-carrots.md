# Roast Carrots

![Roast Carrots](https://recipes.ratcliffefamily.org/images/roast-carrots.jpg)

## ingredients

- 6 large carrots peeled and sliced length-wise
- 2-3 tablespoons roasted garlic flavored extra virgin olive oil
- Salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Wash, peel, and chop your carrots lengthwise. I try to make them uniform and not too small or thin otherwise they'll burn too quickly.
2. In large plastic zip bag, put the carrots, olive oil, salt and pepper.
3. When you're ready to cook the carrots, preheat the oven to 220C. Dump the carrots on a foil-lined baking tray and pop them in the oven.
4. The carrots take around 30-45 minutes to roast off, but I set my oven timer for 10 minute intervals at the beginning and 5 minute intervals near the end to remind me to rotate the tray and flip the carrots.
