# Thai Green Vegetable Curry

## ingredients

- 1 butternut squash (1.2kg)
- Groundnut oil
- 2 x 400g tins of light coconut milk
- 400g leftover cooked greens, such as Brussels sprouts, Brussels tops, kale, cabbage, broccoli
- Sesame oil
- 1 fresh red chilli
- 2 limes

Curry Paste:

- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 shallots
- 5cm piece of ginger
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 4 fresh green chillies
- 2 tablespoons desiccated coconut
- 1 bunch fresh coriander (30g)
- 1 stick lemongrass
- 1 lime

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
2. Wash the squash, cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds, then cut into wedges. In a roasting tray, toss with 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then roast for around 1 hour, or until tender and golden.
3. For the paste, toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan for 2 minutes, then tip into a food processor.
4. Peel, roughly chop and add the garlic, lemongrass, lime juice, shallots and ginger, along with the kaffir lime leaves, 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil, the fish sauce, chillies (pull off the stalks), coconut and most of the coriander (stalks and all).
5. Put 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil into a large casserole pan on a medium heat with the curry paste and fry for 5 minutes to get the flavours going, stirring regularly.
6. Tip in the coconut milk and half a tinâ€™s worth of water, then simmer and thicken on a low heat for 5 minutes.
7. Stir in the roasted squash, roughly chop and add the leftover greens and leave to tick away on the lowest heat, then taste and season to perfection.
