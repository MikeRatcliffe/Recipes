# Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes

## ingredients

- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter

## steps

1. Wash and trim a large head of cauliflower and cut up the florets and stem into pieces of roughly the same size. Don’t worry about how everything looks because it’ll get pulverized later in the food processor.

3. Insert and place a steamer on top.
4. Toss in the stems, half of the florets, and all of the garlic.
5. Salt everything liberally.
6. Toss in the rest of the cauliflower, season with more salt.
7. Cook under high pressure for 3 minutes.
8. Release the pressure manually.
9. Transfer everything into a food processor.
10. Add the ground nutmeg, freshly ground black pepper and the butter.
11. Process until smooth.
12. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
