# Whole Roast Cauliflower

## ingredients

- 1 whole cauliflower head (about 1kg)
- 120ml extra virgin olive oil or melted ghee
- Salt

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 190C and place a rack in the middle position.
2. Trim away the leaves at the bottom of the cauliflower head. Carefully cut off and remove the stem and tough core, but be careful to keep the head intact.
3. Rinse and pat dry the trimmed cauliflower head. Then drizzle olive oil or melted ghee all over it.
4. With your hands, rub the oil on the surface (both top and bottom) until the cauliflower is well coated. Season both sides of the cauliflower liberally with salt.
5. Place the cauliflower florets-side up on a baking tray, and cover tightly with aluminium foil.
6. Put the baking tray on the middle rack in the oven. Cook for 30 minutes, covered.
7. Remove the foil from the baking tray, and roast for an additional hour in the oven. Once the cauliflower is golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside, take it out of the oven. A knife should slide in and out without any resistance.
8. Transfer the cauliflower head to a platter. Carve and serve as-is, or drizzle on your favorite sauce and fresh herbs.
