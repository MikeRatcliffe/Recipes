# Creamy Stovetop Macaroni Cheese

## ingredients

- 450 grams macaroni
- 350ml milk
- 2 tablespoons plain flour
- 700g grated cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon powdered mustard

## steps

1. Cook the pasta until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Place 125ml of milk and flour in a small bowl and whisk together until there are no lumps.
3. Place 250ml of the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When you just start to see wisps of steam rising from the warming milk, whisk in the milk-and-flour mixture.
4. Continue whisking gently until the milk thickens slightly to the consistency of heavy cream, 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Turn the heat to low and begin mixing handfuls of cheese into the milk. Stir in the salt and mustard. Stir until all the cheese has melted and the sauce is creamy. Taste and adjust the seasonings as desired.
6. Remove the sauce from the heat.
7. Combine the pasta and cheese sauce.

## notes

- If you'd like a looser sauce, add up to another 125ml milk if desired. Serve the mac and cheese immediately while still warm.
