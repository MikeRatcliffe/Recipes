# Sheet Pan Salmon Supper

## ingredients

- 120ml rocket pesto
- 450g asparagus (trimmed)
- 2 cups cherry or grape tomatoes
- salt
- pepper
- 60 ml olive oil
- 4 salmon fillets (180g each)
- 2 large lemons

## steps

1. Grab (or make) some Rocket Pesto. Itâ€™ll take just a few minutes!
2. Heat oven to 220C with the rack in the middle position.
3. In a rimmed baking sheet, toss the asparagus and cherry tomatoes with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 cup oil.
4. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer.
5. Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel. Place the fillets in the pan and flip them around to coat all sides with the oil.
6. Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper on both sides and arrange the fillets skin-side down among the veggies.
7. Grab the lemons and cut into 1/2 inch slices. Add the lemon slices to the pan, also flipping them over to coat both sides with oil.
8. Place the pan in the hot oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets, or until salmon is cooked to your desired doneness. (Personally, I like to take the fillets out when the thickest part of the fish measures 57C on a meat thermometer.)
9. When the salmon is done, remove the pan from the oven, and dollop the pesto on the salmon and veggies. Squeeze the lemons on everything and dig in!

## notes

- If asparagus is out of season, broccolini is a great substitute!
