![Frittata](images/frittata.jpg)

## ingredients

- 6 large eggs
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 slices bacon
- 2 potatoes (thinly sliced)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 cups baby spinach
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 cup grated cheese

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 200C.
2. Whisk the eggs, heavy cream, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Cook the bacon, remove from pan but leave the fat in.
4. Fry the potatoes in the bacon fat, sprinkle with the pepper and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes.
5. Pile the spinach into the pan with the garlic and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until spinach wilts.
6. Add the bacon back to the pan and stir to evenly distribute.
7. Spread the vegetables into an even layer, flattening with a spatula. Sprinkle the cheese on top and let it just start to melt.
8. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook for a minute or two until you see the eggs at the edges of the pan beginning to set.
9. Bake the frittata for 8 to 10 minutes.
10. Cool for 5 minutes and serve.
