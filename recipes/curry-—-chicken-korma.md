# Curry - Chicken Korma

## ingredients

Marinade:

- 1 kg boneless chicken breast or thighs (chopped into bite sized pieces)
- 70 g cashews lightly chopped (or use almonds)
- 3 tbsp tomato puree
- 4 cloves garlic (chopped)
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger (minced)
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tsp Chilli flakes
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1/2 tsp cardamom
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 120 ml plain yogurt
- Salt and pepper to taste

Korma:

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2-3 spicy chilli peppers
- 1 medium onion (chopped)
- 120 ml chicken stock or more as needed
- 120 ml heavy cream or coconut milk

## steps

1. Add the chopped chicken to a large bowl and set aside.
2. Add the cashew nuts to a food processor and pulse to break them up.
3. Add the tomato puree, garlic, ginger, and seasonings.
4. Add salt and pepper to taste and pulse to form a thick paste. If it is too thick, add a couple tbsp of water to thin it just slightly.
5. Mix the paste in a small bowl with the yogurt.
6. Spoon the marinade over the chopped chicken and mix well. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour to let the flavors develop. You can leave it overnight to develop even more flavor.
7. When you’re ready to cook, heat the oil in a large pan.
8. Add the peppers and onion and cook them down for 5 minutes to soften.
9. Add the chicken with all of the marinade along with the chicken stock.
10. Stir and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
11. Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk and simmer for 10 more minutes. You can simmer longer if you’d like to let the flavors develop more.
12. Garnish with fresh chopped herbs, spicy red chilli flakes, and cashews to serve.
