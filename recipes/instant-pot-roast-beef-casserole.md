Light Gravy:

## steps

Pot Roast:

1. Add the roast to the Instant Pot. Sprinkle the seasoning over the roast and then rub them into the roast so that the roast is covered with the seasonings.
2. Add the cider vinegar and coconut aminos to the Instant Pot. Pour them to the side so that it doesn't wash the seasonings off the roast. Close the lid and turn the pressure valve to sealing.
3. Cook the pot roast on high pressure using the meat/stew option for one hour.
4. When the timer goes off let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes, then turn the valve to release the rest of the pressure.
5. Remove the lid and add the vegetables. Close the lid again, turn the pressure valve back to sealing.
6. Cook the vegetables on high pressure for 2 minutes using the manual or pressure cook setting.
7. Turn the valve to release the pressure. Open the lid and remove the vegetables and pot roast from Instant Pot. Let the roast rest for at least 10 minutes before shredding and serving.

Gravy:

1. To make a gravy with the dripping in the Instant Pot, add a cup of the broth to a large jar (or to a blender) The broth should still be warm, but not steaming.
2. Add 2-3 tbsp. of butter to the broth. Blend the broth and butter together by using a stick blender, or your regular blender. You will want to blend the broth for 30 second - 1 minute.
3. Serve gravy over your pot roast and vegetables.
