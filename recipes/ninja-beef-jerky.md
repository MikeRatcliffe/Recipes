# Ninja Beef Jerky

## ingredients

- 1 kg of lean beef
- 120 ml soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper

## steps

1. In a large bowl, prepare the marinade by whisking together all ingredients except the beef.
2. Place the marinade and beef slices in a large resealable plastic bag.
3. Massage the outside of the bag to work the marinade over all parts of the beef, then place the bag in the fridge for 8 hours or more to marinate.
4. After marinating, pour the meat and marinade into a colander in the sink. Push the beef around to allow excess marinade to drain.
5. Place the bottom layer of the Deluxe Reversible Rack in the lower position, then place in the pot. 
6. Lay half of the beef slices flat on the rack.
7. Slide the Deluxe Layer through the lower layerâ€™s handles.
8. Lay the remaining beef slices flat on the top layer of the rack. Make sure none of the slices are touching one another.
9. Close the lid and move the slider slider to AIR CRISP. Select DEHYDRATE, set temperature to 70C, and set time to 6 hours. Press START/STOP to begin cooking.
10. When cooking is complete, remove the rack layers with the jerky. Store in an airtight container.
