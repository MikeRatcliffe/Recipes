## ingredients

- 1 x 5.6 kg / 12 pounds high welfare turkey roughly 2kg meat
- 1 bunch rosemary 15g
- 1 bunch thyme 15g
- 1 bunch sage 15g
- 5 bay leaves 1g
- 1 - 2 tbsp olive oil to baste
- 78 g parma ham approx. 6 thin slices

Gravy Trivet:

- Turkey giblets
- 1 small onion 60g
- 1 carrot peeled and quartered
- 2 sticks celery chopped in half
- 1 bulb garlic halved
- 240 ml water

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 180 C / 160 fan.
2. Check the cavity for giblets. If they are there, remove and put in the roasting tray (minus the bag) for tasty gravy.
3. Add the onion, carrot, celery and garlic to your tray plus water.
4. Add the herbs to the cavity but leave enough space for air to circulate.
5. Rub olive oil all over the turkey and into the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the top and bottom with salt and pepper.
6. Place the turkey on top of the trivet (upside down for the juiciest bird) and cover with tin foil.

Cooking Times:

1. Cook a high welfare bird for 25 - 30 mins per kilo, standard 35 - 40 mins per kilo. Mine was 5.6kg and took about 3hrs 10 mins.
2. If cooking upside down, cook for 1 hour and then turn the right way (breast up) and cover with foil again.
3. About 1 hour before the end of cooking, remove the foil and baste the turkey with the pan juices. 15 - 20 minutes before the end of cooking add the parma ham.
4. To check it’s done, pierce into the thick part of the turkey breast or thigh with a knife or skewer. If the juices run clear, it's done.
5. Lift the turkey from the trivet using a big carving fork. Cover the turkey with a clean tea towel or foil and rest for around 1 hr before carving.

## notes

- Allow the turkey to come to room temperature before baking. Take it out of the fridge at least 2 hours before roasting.
- Turn the turkey upside down for the first hour in the oven. This allows all the fat from the bottom to season the breast.
- Just remember if using a trivet this will leave small indentions in the breasts. If covering with parma ham you won’t notice them (plus it looks pretty & tastes great).
- Cover in tin foil for the first couple of hours so the bird stays juicy. For the same reason, allow to rest with a clean tea towel over it for an hour before carving.
- Make the gravy using the pan juices and the vegetables while the turkey is resting. Here's the full recipe for keto gravy
