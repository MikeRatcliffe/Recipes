# Spicy Tuna Cakes

## ingredients

- 3 tbsp melted ghee (divided)
- 300 g canned albacore tuna packed in water (drained)
- 3 spring onions (thinly sliced)
- 2 tbsp fresh coriander (finely chopped)
- 175 g sweet potato (mashed)
- Zest from 1/2 medium lemon
- 15 ml jalapeño pepper (crushed)
- 2 large eggs
- 2.5 ml chillies (crushed)
- Salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 175C, and use a brush to grease a 12-slot regular sized muffin tin with one tbsp of melted ghee.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the tuna, spring onions, and coriander. Add the mashed sweet potato to the tuna mixture, and gently combine.
3. Then, mix in the lemon zest, jalapeño, the remaining two tbsp of ghee, eggs, and crushed chillies. Season with salt and pepper to taste. I normally use 1 tsp salt.
4. Use your hands to mix everything together because that way you can make sure that the fish chunks aren’t overly broken up.
5. Scoop a 60 ml of the mixture into each greased muffin tin slot and flatten with the back of a spoon.
6. Bake the tuna cakes for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out cleanly.
7. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool. The easiest way I’ve found to get them out is to put the wire rack on top of the muffin tin, flip everything upside-down, and tap them gently on the counter.
