## ingredients

Taco seasoning:

- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp paprika powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp chili flakes
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried or fresh oregano

Omelette:

- 140 g minced beef
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lime, juiced (optional)
- 1 avocado
- 140 g shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 tomato, diced
- 1 tsp fresh coriander
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper

## steps

1. Combine all ingredients for the taco seasoning.
2. Add minced beef to a large non-stick skillet.
3. Add taco seasoning mix, combine well and fry until fully cooked.
4. Remove from heat and set aside in a bowl.
5. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until fluffy.
6. Lower the heat and add olive oil in the same skillet. Add the eggs. As the edges are becoming solid, push the edges towards the middle, allowing the uncooked parts to flow to the edge. Cook for a few minutes, keep the insides a bit runny.
7. Squeeze lime on the minced beef. Combine well.
8. Cut avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop out the flesh. Cut into pieces.
9. Distribute minced beef on top of the omelet. Add 2/3 of the shredded cheese and chopped tomatoes.
   Carefully remove the omelet from the skillet. Fold and top with more cheese, avocado and coriander.
10. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
