## ingredients

Sauce:

- 3 tablespoons coconut aminos
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced
- 1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon arrowroot powder
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chicken broth

Stir-Fry:

- 1 tablespoon avocado oil, divided
- 3 1/2 cups broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons water for blanching broccoli
- 3/4 pound flank steak
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced
- 1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

## steps

Make the sauce:

1. Whisk together all of the ingredients for the sauce. In a separate bowl, season the beef with salt and pepper and add 1 tablespoon of the sauce over the beef and stir until coated. Set aside.

Meanwhile blanch the broccoli:

1. In a wok or non-stick pan, heat 1 teaspoon of oil.
2. Add the broccoli florets and cook for about 1-2 minutes, until tender, add a tablespoon of water if necessary.
3. Transfer broccoli to a plate.
4. Wipe pan down & heat remainder of the oil over high heat. Allow the pan to get hot enough that you start seeing a little bit of smoke rising.
5. Quickly add the beef to the smoking pan and spread the pieces out to a single layer allowing them to sear and brown.
6. Add the garlic and continue cooking until the meat is no longer pink (about 1-2 minutes making sure not to overcook).
7. Pour in the sauce, stirring constantly, until the sauce boils and thickens - about 30 seconds. Add more water if needed to thin out the sauce.
8. Quickly stir in the broccoli and toss everything together to coat well.
9. Salt and pepper to taste.
