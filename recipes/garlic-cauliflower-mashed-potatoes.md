# Garlic Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes

## ingredients

- 1 large cauliflower
- 5 large garlic cloves (peeled and sliced)
- Salt
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp butter

## steps

1. Start by filling a 6 litre stock pot with an inch or two of water. Put the pot on the hob on high, dump in a steamer insert, and put on the lid.
2. While the water heats up, wash and trim a large head of cauliflower and cut up the florets and stem into pieces of roughly the same size.
3. Once the water in the pot is boiling, throw in the stems, half of the florets, and all of the garlic. Salt everything liberally.
4. Toss in the rest of the cauliflower, season with more salt, replace the lid, and steam everything until soft (~10 minutes).
5. Once the florets are done cooking, transfer everything into a food processor.
6. Add the nutmeg, black pepper and the butter.
7. Process until smooth.
