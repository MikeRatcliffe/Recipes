2. Pour in the diced tomatoes, water and potatoes if using.
3. Secure the lid, close the pressure valve and cook for 45 minutes at high pressure.
4. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
5. If you’d like for the dish to have a thicker consistency, press the sauté button to reduce or boil off extra liquid.
