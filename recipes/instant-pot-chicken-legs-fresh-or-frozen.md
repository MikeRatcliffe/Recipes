## ingredients

- 240ml water (1 cup)
- 14-16 chicken drumsticks
- Your favorite sauce (I like buffalo or teriyaki sauce)

## steps

Cook the chicken:

1. Add 1 cup water and the trivet to the Instant Pot.
2. Stack fresh or frozen chicken drumsticks/legs on top of trivet.
3. Lock the lid, turn the knob to sealing, and cook on Manual High pressure for 10 minutes for fresh, 11 minutes for semi-frozen, and 12 minutes for frozen.

Finishing:

1. Turn the grill or grill on high.
2. Do a quick release, then remove the chicken legs to a grill pan.
3. Sprinkle the chicken legs with salt and pepper, if desired. You could also baste simply with butter or olive oil for plain chicken legs.
4. Baste the chicken legs with your favorite sauce.
5. Grill for 3 minutes, then remove from the oven.
6. Flip them over, repeat.
7. Baste with extra sauce after the second grilling.
