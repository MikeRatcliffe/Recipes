## steps

Prepare The Brisket:

1. Put the brisket in a ziplock bag.
2. Add the dry rub to the bag and massage it into the meat.
3. Allow at least 1 hour at room temperature to help the seasoning penetrate the meat. Overnight in the refrigerator would be best for the flavors to penetrate the brisket.

Cooking:

1. Sear the seasoned beef brisket in the Instant Pot. Sear on all sides, being sure to take your time searing the meat and sealing in the favor. Golden brown on all sides.
2. Add in the beef stock. Add enough to cover the brisket 2/3 of the way up the sides.
3. Next, add the lard and the extra black pepper.
4. Pressure cook on high for 1 hour 15 minutes.
5. Quick release... wait 15 minutes before opening the lid.
