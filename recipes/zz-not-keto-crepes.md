# NOT KETO - Crêpes

## ingredients

- 175 g plain flour (sieved)
- 3 large eggs
- 450 ml milk
- Salt
- Oil (for frying)

## steps

1. Weigh the flour in a large jug or bowl.
2. Crack in the eggs, add half the milk and a pinch of salt.
3. Whisk to a smooth, thick batter.
4. Add the remaining milk and whisk again. Set aside for at least 30 mins.
5. Heat a large non-stick crêpe pan or frying pan.
6. Add a drizzle of oil, then wipe out the excess with kitchen paper.
7. When the pan is hot, add enough batter to just cover the surface, swirling it and pouring any excess back into the bowl. The pancake should be as thin as possible.
8. When the edges are peeling away from the sides of the pan, shake it to see if the pancake easily releases and is browning on the underside. If not, cook a little longer.
9. Flip and cook the other side for a minute or two.
10. Serve, or keep warm in a low oven.
