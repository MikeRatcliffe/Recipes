## ingredients

- 700g chicken preferably with skin on (about 5-6 pieces, thighs and leg pieces are best)
- 2 onions chopped
- 2 tomatoes chopped
- 1/2 kg baby potatoes halved
- 3 carrots cut into 1cm pieces
- 3 celery stalks cut into chunks
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- Few sprigs of rosemary
- 120ml white wine optional
- 2 teaspoon Worscestershire sauce
- 480ml of chicken stock
- 2 teaspoon red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons arrowroot powder

## steps

1. Add chicken pieces (thighs and legs with skin on) into the pot along with onions, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, celery stalks, garlic, salt and pepper, bay leaf, rosemary leaves, worcestershire sauce and little chicken stock or water into the pot.
2. Put the lid on and make sure the pressure valve is in sealing position. Use manual setting and adjust timer to 10 minutes. Remember instant pot will take time to build pressure, about 20 minutes. Only after that the cooking timer will start.
3. Once cooking time is over, allow instant pot to sit for 10 minutes (Natural pressure release).
4. Turn pressure valve to venting position to release any pressure left in the pot.
5. Open the lid.
6. Stir in red wine vinegar. In a small bowl whisk arrowroot powder with water. Pour into the pot.
7. Select saute setting and let stew simmer for 3-4 minutes more or until it thickens. Remember chicken stew will thicken as it cools down.
8. Garnish with fresh thyme and serve it with crusty warm bread.
