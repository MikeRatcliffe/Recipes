# Steak Fajita Skillet

## ingredients

- 227g Sirlion Steak
- 1/4 tsp Salt
- 1/8 tsp Black Pepper
- 1/8 tsp Cumin Seed
- 1/4 tsp Paprika
- 2 tsp Olive Oil
- 1/2 tbsp Olive Oil
- Peppers
- 1/8 tsp Salt
- 1/8 tsp Black Pepper
- 30g Monterey Cheese, grated

## steps

1. Lay the sirloin on a flat surface, and rub it down with the first amounts of salt and pepper, cumin, paprika, and the first amount of olive oil.
2. Drizzle the second amount of olive oil in a skillet, and cook the steak on high heat for 6-7 minutes per side - until it’s cooked through and has a golden brown char on the outside. Remove the steak from the skillet, and set it aside to rest.
3. Slice the pepper into strips. Turn the skillet heat down to medium-low, and cook the peppers until they’re soft and browned with the remaining salt and pepper.
4. Slice the cooked steak into strips. Return them to the skillet with the peppers, and turn the heat off. Sprinkle the cheese over the ingredients so it melts slightly.
