## ingredients

- 500ml beef broth
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tsp tomato paste
- 1/8 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp sea salt

## steps

1. Place all of the ingredients except the sea salt in a saucepan. Stir with a whisk to mix.
2. Over high heat, bring the sauce to a quick boil. Once the boiling, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 minutes. The sauce will reduce and concentrate.
3. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Taste and season with sea salt if needed. Start with 1/4 tsp, mix and taste. Add more as desired.
4. Place in a jar with an airtight lid and refrigerate for up to two weeks (see recipe notes). Use as a 1 to 1 replacement for coconut aminos.
