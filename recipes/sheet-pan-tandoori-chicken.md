# Sheet Pan Tandoori Chicken

## ingredients

Tandoori Marinade:

- 226 g full-fat coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons tandoori spice mix (no salt added)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

Sheet Pan Tandoori Chicken:

- 1 tablespoon fat of choice
- 1 small cauliflower 1 kg or less (cut into florets)
- 1 small red onion (cut into thin wedges)
- 680 g chicken thighs (boneless and skinless)
- 4 g minced fresh coriander optional
- 1 lemon cut into wedges (optional)

## steps

1. Heat oven to 200C with the rack in the middle.
2. Whisk together the coconut milk, tandoori spice, salt, and lemon juice. (Got a bottle of Nom Nom Paleo Tandoori? Just measure out 240 ml of it in place of making your own marinade!)
3. Use a pastry brush to evenly spread the avocado oil over the bottom of a rimmed baking sheet.
4. Place the cauliflower and onions in a large bowl and pour in half of the tandoori marinade. Toss well to coat.
5. Shake off the excess marinade and arrange the cauliflower and onions on the greased baking sheet.
6. Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and pour in the remaining marinade. Toss well to coat evenly with the tandoori marinade.
7. Arrange the thighs in a single layer on the sheet pan with the cauliflower.
8. Pop the sheet pan dinner in the oven and roast for 25 to 35 minutes, flipping the cauliflower and rotating the tray 180° at the halfway point.
9. The sheet pan dinner is done when the cauliflower is tender and browned and the chicken is cooked through (a meat thermometer should read 74C in the thickest part of the thigh).
10. Sprinkle on the minced coriander and serve with lemon wedges. Dig in!

## notes

- If you’re using bottled Nom Nom Paleo Tandoori, just substitute 1 cup of it for the marinade! The Tandoori marinade can solidify in the fridge, just take it out for 30 minutes before you use it to loosen it up!
- You can store the leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days and in the freezer for up to 4 months.
- You can experiment with different vegetable combinations. I love using Brussels sprouts and broccoli in this dish!
