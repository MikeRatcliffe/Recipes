# Sheet Pan Chicken Stir-Fry

## ingredients

- 120 ml All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil plus more for greasing the sheet pan
- 2 tsp arrowroot powder
- 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- 700 g boneless and skinless chicken breasts cut into 1-inch cubes
- 450 g sugar snap peas trimmed
- 110 g fresh shiitake mushrooms cut in half or quarters
- 1 large carrot cut into 1/4 inch slices
- 1 large shallot thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 2 scallions thinly sliced

## steps

1. Heat the oven to 200°C with the rack in the middle.
2. While the oven is heating up, whisk together the All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce, oil, arrowroot powder, and salt in a liquid measuring cup or bowl.
3. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, sugar snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, shallot, and garlic. Pour in the sauce and toss well to combine.
4. Grease a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil or line it with parchment paper. Transfer the chicken and veggies to the baking sheet and arrange in a single layer.
5. Bake for 14 to 17 minutes, rotating the pan at the midway point. The sheet pan chicken dinner is ready when the vegetables are tender-crisp and browned in parts and the chicken is cooked through.
6. Sprinkle on the sliced scallions and serve with some simple cauliflower rice!

## notes

- If you want to make this recipe ahead of time, toss the ingredients together in the marinade and keep it refrigerated in a sealed container. You can do this the night before or the morning of—but don’t try to get too far ahead of yourself: if you marinate the ingredients for too long, the veggies and chicken will start oozing extra liquid or start breaking down.
- Leftovers can be kept in the fridge in a sealed container for up to 4 days.
