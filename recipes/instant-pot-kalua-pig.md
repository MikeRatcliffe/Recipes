# Instant Pot Kalua Pig

## ingredients

- 3 slices thick-cut bacon
- 2.5kg bone in pork shoulder
- 5 peeled garlic cloves
- 3/4 tbsp salt
- 1 cabbage, cored and cut into 6 wedges

## steps

1. Line the bottom of the instant pot with the bacon.
2. Saute the bacon for 5 minutes, flipping once half-way through.
3. In the meantime cut the pork into 3 equal pieces.
4. With a sharp paring knife, make a few slits in each piece of pork and tuck the garlic cloves into these slits.
5. Season the pork with salt.
6. Arrange the pork in a single layer on top of the bacon.
7. Pour in 240ml water.
8. Cook under high pressure for 90 minutes.
9. Let the pressure release naturally. The meat should be fall-apart tender, otherwise cook for another 5-10 minutes.
10. Transfer the cooked pork into a large bowl. Taste the remaining liquid in the pot, and adjust the seasoning with more water or salt as required.
11. Add the cabbage to the liquid.
12. Cook at high pressure for 3-5 minutes then use the quick-release valve to depressurise.
13. Shred the pork, divide it into serving bowls, top with cabbage and serve.
