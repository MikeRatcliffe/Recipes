# Pesto - Rocket

## ingredients

- 480ml tightly packed rocket
- 240ml tightly packed Italian parsley
- 120ml toasted almond slivers
- 1 tablespoon capers (rinsed and drained)
- 1 medium garlic clove
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 120ml extra virgin olive oil
- salt
- pepper

## steps

1. In a food processor or blender, combine the rocket, parsley, almonds, capers, garlic cloves, and lemon juice. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping the sides down if needed.
2. Then, while the food processor is running, pour the olive oil through the feed tube.
3. Process until smooth (or your desired chunkiness). Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Arugula Pesto can be refrigerated for 4 days or frozen in ice cube trays for up to 6 months. (You wonâ€™t be sorry if you decide to double the recipe!)
