# Slow Cooker - Pork Joint

## ingredients

- 1.5 kg smoked gammon (deboned)
- 2 apples (roughly chopped)
- 1 onion (roughly chopped)
- 2 cloves garlic (peeled)
- 1 carrot (roughly chopped)
- 330 ml cider or apple juice
- 750 ml chicken stock made with a stock cube

Glaze:

- 115 ml maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon English mustard (optional)
- 2 teaspoons mixed spice

## steps

1. Unwrap the gammon, but leave the strings tied. Place the gammon joint in the bowl of your slow cooker. 
2. Roughly chop the onions, carrots and apple and place around the ham. Theyâ€™re just used to flavour the cooking liquid for the gammon.
3. Pour the cider and chicken stock into the slow cooker and cook on high for about 3 hours, or on low for 5-6 hours.
4. Mix the maple syrup and mustard and mixed spice in a small sauce bowl. Whisk well.
5. Remove the gammon from the slow cooker, place on a baking tray and remove the string.
6. Score the skin of the gammon.
7. Pour half the glaze over the cooked gammon and place under the grill for 5 minutes.
8. Remove and pour a little more of the glaze on the ham and place back under the grill for another 5 minutes.
9. Slice the gammon and serve with more mustard and drizzle with the last of the glaze.
