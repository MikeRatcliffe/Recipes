# Roasted Green Beans with Lemon and Garlic

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 1 teaspoon Magic Mushroom Powder or salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 500g green beans

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 220C with the rack in the middle.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, Magic Mushroom Powder or salt, and pepper.
3. Add the green beans and toss well to coat.
4. Arrange the green beans in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
5. Pop the green beans in the oven and roast for 10-15 min if you have the thinner green beans, and 15-20 min if you have the thicker green beans, flipping every 5 minutes to ensure even browning. The green beans are ready when they are tender and charred in some parts.
6. Serve the roasted green beans with lemon wedges because a squeeze of tart juice will add extra zing to these roasted green beans!
