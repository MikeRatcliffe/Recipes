# Keto Zucchini Noodle Alfredo

## Ingredients

- 1.2 kg courgettes, spiralised
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 170 g unsalted butter
- 700 ml heavy cream
- 170 g cream cheese
- 170 g Parmesan cheese or other Italian hard cheese
- 170 g grated cheddar cheese
- 1 tsp chopped oregano
- 1 tbsp chopped basil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Prepare the zucchini noodles using a spiraliser.
2. Place the spiralised zucchini into a colander over the sink.
3. Sprinkle with salt and leave to drain.
4. Add the butter to a pan and melt.
5. Add the garlic and cook gently until soft.
6. Add the cream and bring to a simmer.
7. Add the cream cheese and quarter of the shredded cheeses and stir well until the cheese has completely melted.
8. Keep adding the shredded cheese in batches until it is all melted and you have a smooth, creamy sauce. It will seem like the cheese will never melt. Don’t get panicked and turn up the heat, just keepup the stirring and I promise it will happen.
9. Add the herbs and mix through.
10. Take sauce off the heat to sit and thicken slightly. Stir every now and then to stop a skin forming.
11. Pat the zoodles dry with a paper towel.
12. Pour your olive oil into a frypan and heat.
13. Toss zoodles in the oil and sauté very quickly until just softened (about 1 or 2 minutes). Do not overcook the zoodles or they will become watery and mushy.
14. Place the zoodles in a large serving dish and toss with the Alfredo sauce.
15. Finish off with some grated parmesan, a sprinkle of black pepper and some fresh basil.
