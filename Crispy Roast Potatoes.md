# Crispy Roast Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 1kg floury potatoes - such as Maris Piper
- 120g melted duck fat
- 1 tsp Maldon salt
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220C.
2. Peel the potatoes and chop into chunky pieces.
3. Place in a pan and cover with cold water. Place on the hob on a high heat and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 8-9 minutes - until softened at the edges.
4. Drain the potatoes in a colander and give them a good shake to really roughen up the edges. Don't worry if a few break apart and they look overly fluffy. The more fluffy they are, the better they'll absorb the fat and the crispier they'll be.
5. Put the potatoes back in the pan and add the melted duck fat.
6. Add to a roasting tin and cook for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.
