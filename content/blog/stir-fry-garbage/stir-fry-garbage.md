## description

The whole idea behind emergency protein is that I want to cook some protein and veggies really quickly so it gets in my rumbling belly FAST. Plus, I want to make sure I make a big batch so I have leftovers! This "recipe" makes use of whatever protein and wilting veggies are in the fridge or freezer.

## ingredients

- 450 g quick cooking veggies (pre-washed e.g. baby spinach, leftover saut√©ed chard, frozen broccoli, grated carrots, broccoli slaw, etc.)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 26 g onions, spring onions, or shallots (finely chopped)
- 450 g minced beef or any minced or thinly sliced meat
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- Salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Chop up your veggies.
2. Melt 2 tbsp of ghee over medium heat in a large cast iron frying pan.
3. Toss in the chopped onions and stir fry until tender.
4. Add in your veggies. Start with the veggie that needs the longest to cook (e.g., carrots) along with some salt and pepper to taste.
5. Toss in your meat along with your seasoning and additional salt and pepper.
6. Serve!
