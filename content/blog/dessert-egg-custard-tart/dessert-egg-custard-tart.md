Traditional Egg Custard Tart with a lovely homemade pastry and a very silky smooth filling. Serve warm or chilled. I love mine chilled! You can also make mini ones in a muffin pan if you prefer!

## ingredients

### Pastry

- 180 g plain flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 120 g unsalted butter (cold)
- 25 g caster sugar
- 1 large egg yolk

### Custard

- 350 ml whole milk
- 6 large egg yolks
- 45 g caster sugar
- 1 tsp grated nutmeg
- 4 tbsp butter (softened)
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

## steps

### Make The Pastry

1. To a mixing bowl, add the flour, salt and butter.
2. Rub the butter between your fingers, incorporating the dough until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. 
3. Stir in the sugar, egg yolk and 2 tsp water.
4. Mix until the dough comes together in a ball.
5. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 200°C.

### Make The Custard

1. Add the milk to a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Heat until it starts to lightly simmer, do not boil. Turn off the heat.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and bubbly.
4. Remove the milk from the heat and very slowly drizzle into the egg yolks while whisking.
5. Whisk in the vanilla then transfer the mix to a container with a spout.
6. Rub softened butter inside 12, 7cm tart molds and place onto a large baking sheet.
7. When the dough is chilled, roll out onto a floured surface.
8. Bake at 200°C for 20 minutes then turn the oven down to 180°C (if you see it browning too soon, turn it down sooner) then bake for a further 10 minutes until the pasty is browned and the custard is set but will still have a slight wobble in the center.
9. This will firm when it is cool.
10. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.
