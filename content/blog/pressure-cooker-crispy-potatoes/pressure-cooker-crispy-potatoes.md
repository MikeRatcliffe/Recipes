## description

Let me show you how to use an pressure cooker to make spuds with crispy exteriors and fluffy interiors in no time flat.

## ingredients

- 450 g potatoes (peeled and cut into 2 cm cubes)
- 2 tbsp ghee
- Salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Add 120 ml of water to the pressure cooker.
2. Dump in the potatoes.
3. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes.
4. Natural release for 10 minutes, then quick release.
5. Melt the ghee or butter over medium high heat in a large frying pan. Once it starts sputtering, carefully add the potatoes to the pan.
6. Season generously with salt and pepper.
7. Leave the potatoes undisturbed for 1 minute before flipping to brown the other side for an additional minute.
