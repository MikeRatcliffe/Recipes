## description

A perfectly portioned frying pan with mushrooms, spinach, parmesan and sunny side up eggs.

## ingredients

- 2 egg whites
- 2 whole eggs
- 60 ml heavy cream
- 1 garlic clove (minced)
- 1 shallot (thinly sliced)
- 50 g mushrooms

- 25 g parmesan (grated)
- 1 tbsp olive oil

1. Preheat oven to 200C. In a mini cast iron frying pan, sauté mushrooms in olive oil for 3-4 minutes.
2. Add garlic and shallots and continue sautéing for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
3. Add spinach and sauté until wilted, another minute.
4. Add butter while frying pan is still hot and let it melt into the veggies.
5. Separate 2 egg whites in a bowl, add 60 ml heavy cream and parmesan. Whisk lightly to combine.
6. Pour the egg white/cream mixture into the frying pan, over the vegetables.
7. Dot with cream cheese and sprinkle a pinch of salt and black pepper.
8. Bake for 10 minutes.
9. Remove frying pan and crack 2 whole eggs on top of the baked egg whites and veggies.
10. Put frying pan back in the oven and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove frying pan and let rest for 5 until eggs are done. If you don't like runny eggs, bake for a few minutes longer.
