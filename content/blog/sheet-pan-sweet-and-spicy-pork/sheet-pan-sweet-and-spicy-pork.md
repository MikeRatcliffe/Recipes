This Keto friendly Sheet Pan Sweet and Spicy Pork is perfect for busy weeknights when you want a healthy and delicious dinner in no time flat! The tangy marinade has a slight kick and tastes great on many protein and vegetable combinations!

## ingredients

- 1 kg pork tenderloin (cut into 1-inch medallions)
- Salt
- 170 g plum, peach or apricot jam
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Sriracha
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- Black pepper
- 450 g green beans (trimmed)
- 110 g fresh shiitake mushrooms (stemmed and quartered)
- 1 medium red bell pepper (cut into 2.5 cm squares)
- 1/2 medium red onion (cut into 1 cm wedges)
- 2 spring onions (sliced diagonally)

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 220C, with one rack in the upper middle position and another one in the lower middle position. While you're waiting for the oven to heat up, prep the ingredients.
2. Grab the pork medallions and toss well with 1 1/2 tsp salt.
3. Next, combine the jam, soy sauce, sriracha, tomato puree, fish sauce, garlic, and 1/4 tsp black pepper in a large bowl. Whisk until smooth.
4. Add the pork to the bowl and mix well. Arrange the pork in a single-layer on two rimmed baking sheets.
5. Toss in the green beans, mushrooms, bell pepper, onions, and 1 tsp salt to the bowl with the remaining sauce. Use your hands to coat all the vegetables evenly in the sauce.
6. Arrange the veggies in a single layer around the pork on the baking sheets.
7. Pop the trays in the oven and roast for a total of 15 to 20 minutes or until the pork is cooked through (60C in the thickest parts of the pork medallions), swapping the pans at the halfway point to ensure even doneness.
8. If you want your pork and veggies with a little more charred, place each tray about 15 cm under the grill for a few minutes to brown.
9. Top with spring onions and serve.
