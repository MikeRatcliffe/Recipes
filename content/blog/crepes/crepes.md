## description

Use this easy crêpe mix to make sweet or savoury pancakes. There's enough batter to make a main course and dessert for a family of four.

## ingredients

- 350 g plain flour (sieved)
- 6 large eggs
- 900 ml milk
- Salt
- Oil (for frying)

## steps

### Batter

1. Sieve flour into a large jug or bowl.
2. Add eggs, milk and a pinch of salt.
3. Use a stick blender to make a smooth batter.
4. Set aside for at least 30 mins (a couple of hours is best).

### Cooking

1. Heat a non-stick crêpe pan or frying pan.
2. Add a drizzle of oil, then wipe out the excess with kitchen paper.
3. When the pan is hot, add enough batter to just cover the surface, swirling it and pouring any excess back into the bowl. The pancake should be as thin as possible.
4. When the edges are peeling away from the sides of the pan, shake it to see if the pancake easily releases and is browning on the underside. If not, cook a little longer.
5. Flip and cook the other side for a minute or two.
6. Serve, or keep warm in a low oven.
