## description

Pressure cooked Chicken Legs from fresh or frozen are ridiculously easy, juicy, and never dry. Make chicken drumsticks in the pressure cooked with only two ingredients!

## ingredients

- 240 ml water
- 14-16 chicken drumsticks
- Your favorite sauce (I like buffalo or teriyaki sauce)

## steps

### Cook the chicken

1. Add 240 ml water and the trivet to the pressure cooker.
2. Stack fresh or frozen chicken drumsticks/legs on top of trivet.
3. Lock the lid, turn the knob to sealing, and cook on Manual High pressure for 10 minutes for fresh, 11 minutes for semi-frozen, and 12 minutes for frozen.

### Finishing

1. Do a quick release, then remove the chicken legs to a bowl.
2. Turn the grill on high or pre-heat the air fryer.
3. Sprinkle the chicken legs with salt and pepper, if desired. You could also baste simply with butter or olive oil for plain chicken legs.
4. Baste the chicken legs with your favorite sauce.
5. Grill / air fry for 3 minutes, then remove from the oven / air fryer.
6. Flip them over, repeat as needed.
7. Baste with extra sauce after the second grilling / air frying.
