## description

Chickpeas – the star ingredient in houmous – are incredibly good for you. High in protein and fibre and more than ten micronutrients, including a hefty amount of the mineral copper, keeping our hair and skin nice and healthy, this is a great, nutritious snack.

## ingredients

- 1 x 400 g tin of chickpeas
- 1 small clove of garlic
- 1 tbsp tahini
- 1 lemon
- Extra virgin olive oil

## steps

1. Drain and tip the chickpeas into a food processor.
2. Peel and add the garlic, then add the tahini, a good squeeze of lemon juice and 1 tbsp of oil.
3. Season with a pinch of sea salt, then pop the lid on and blitz.
4. Use a spatula to scrape the houmous down the sides of the bowl, then blitz again until smooth.
5. Have a taste and add more lemon juice or a splash of water to loosen, if needed, then transfer to a serving bowl.
