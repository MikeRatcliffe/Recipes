## description

What's better than slow-cooked goat curry? Goat curry that tastes slow-cooked but is actually made in a fraction of the time!

## ingredients

### Marinade

- 50 g butter (melted)
- 7.5cm fresh ginger (minced)
- 5 cloves garlic (minced)
- 4 whole cloves
- 4 cardamom pods (seeds only)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tbsp coriander
- 1 1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1/4 – 1/2 tsp cayenne (adjust to taste)

### Cooking

- 25 g butter
- 1 onion (diced)
- 900 g goat pieces
- 200 ml water

## steps

### Marinade

1. Blend all of the marinade ingredients using a blender.
2. Marinate for at least 4 hours... overnight if possible.

### Cooking

1. Sauté the butter and onion.
2. Add the marinated goat meat and as much as the marinade that you can.
3. Sauté until the meat is browned.
4. Add the water and secure the lid. Close the pressure valve and cook for 45 minutes at high pressure.
5. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
6. If you'd like the dish to have a thicker consistency, sauté to reduce or boil off extra liquid.
