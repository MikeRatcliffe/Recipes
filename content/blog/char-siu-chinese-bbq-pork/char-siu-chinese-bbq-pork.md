Char siu, or Chinese BBQ Pork, is a delicious Cantonese roast meat. Make authentic Chinatown char siu at home with our restaurant-quality recipe!

## ingredients

- 1.4 kg boneless pork shoulder (a fatty piece)
- 50 g granulated white sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp five spice powder
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- 1/2 tsp sesame oil
- 15 ml rice wine
- 15 ml soy sauce
- 15 ml hoisin sauce
- 2 tsp molasses
- 3 cloves garlic (finely minced)
- 30 ml honey
- 15 ml hot water

## steps

### Marinade (BBQ Sauce)

1. Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses and garlic in a bowl.

### Prepare The Pork

1. Reserve about 2 tbsp of marinade and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.

### Cooking

1. Cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 5 cm thick. Donâ€™t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
2. Preheat your oven to 220 C with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven.
3. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top.
4. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces.
5. Pour 350 ml water into the pan below the rack.
6. Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. Roast for 25 minutes, keeping the oven setting at 220 C for the first 10 minutes of roasting, and then reduce your oven temperature to 190 C.
7. After 25 minutes, flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water.
8. Roast another 15 minutes. Throughout the roasting time, check your char siu often (every 10 minutes) and reduce the oven temperature if it looks like it is burning!
9. Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the honey and 1 tbsp hot water.
10. After 40 minutes of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side as well. Roast for a final 10 minutes.
11. By now, the pork has cooked for 50 minutes total. It should be cooked through and caramelized on top.
12. Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, and enjoy!
