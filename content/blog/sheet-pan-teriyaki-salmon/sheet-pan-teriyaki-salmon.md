## description

This Keto sheet pan Teriyaki Salmon is cinch to make and a breeze to clean up!

## ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (150 g each)
- 175 ml All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 450 g French green beans (trimmed)
- 110 g fresh shiitake mushrooms (quartered)
- 1 red bell pepper (cored and thinly sliced)
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds (toasted)
- 2 spring onions (thinly sliced)

## steps

1. Place the salmon fillets in a high-sided dish where they'll fit snugly. Pour in 80 ml of All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce.
2. Flip the salmon around in the marinade to coat well. Keep the fillets skin-side up in the marinade until you're ready to cook. Marinate the fish for as little as 15 minutes, but no longer than 8 hours.
3. When you're ready to cook the sheet pan dinner, heat the oven to 200C with the rack in the middle.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together 60 ml All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce with 1 tbsp olive oil. (You should have about 2 tbsp of "clean" All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce remaining to brush over everything later.)
5. Add the green beans, mushrooms, and bell pepper in the sauce and toss well.
6. Place the salmon skin-side down in the middle of a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the vegetables evenly and in a single layer around the salmon.
7. Bake the sheet pan dinner for 10 to 15 minutes or until the salmon is cooked to your preferred doneness. (I like the salmon cooked to about medium, about 54C to 57C in the thickest part of the fillet.)
8. Once the salmon is finished cooking and the vegetables are browned, brush on the reserved "fresh" All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce (not the stuff the salmon was marinated in) to add a bright kick of flavour.
9. Sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds and sliced spring onions to finish the dish!
