## description

This lamb curry's a popular restaurant classic that's really easy to make at home. It's a rich, crowd pleasing lamb dish that the whole family will enjoy

## ingredients

- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 450 g lamb stew meat (cut into 1 1/2" chunks)
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 2 large carrots (coarsely chopped)
- 2 small onions (coarsely chopped)
- 120 g mushrooms (quartered)
- 7 garlic cloves (crushed)
- 2 tbsp rogan josh seasoning
- 120 ml full-fat coconut milk
- 120 ml water

## steps

1. Assemble your ingredients. Chop your veggies and preheat your oven to 150C.
2. Heat the coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Toss the lamb with salt and pepper in a separate bowl.
3. Once the pot is hot, sear the lamb chunks in a single layer for about 4 minutes undisturbed on each side.
4. Remove the browned lamb to a separate plate once browned, and add the carrots and onions to the empty pot. When the onions are translucent throw in the mushrooms along with a dash of salt and pepper.
5. After the liquid has cooked off, toss in the garlic and stir everything around until fragrant (around 30 seconds).
6. Add the lamb back into the pot along with the Rogan Josh seasoning. Stir and make sure everything is well distributed.
7. Pour in the coconut milk and water. The liquid level should be about 3/4 the way up the meat and veggies. Cover your pot and stick it in your oven until the meat is nice and tender (about 1.5 to 2 hours).
