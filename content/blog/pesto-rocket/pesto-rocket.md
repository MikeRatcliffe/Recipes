## description

Arugula Pesto is a simple and versatile flavor booster that takes your food to the next level in no time flat!

## ingredients

- 480 ml rocket (tightly packed)
- 240 ml italian parsley (tightly packed)
- 120 ml almond slivers (toasted)
- 1 tbsp capers (rinsed and drained)
- 1 medium garlic clove
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 120 ml extra virgin olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper

## steps

1. In a food processor or blender, combine the rocket, parsley, almonds, capers, garlic cloves, and lemon juice. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping the sides down if needed.
2. Then, while the food processor is running, pour the olive oil through the feed tube.
3. Process until smooth (or your desired chunkiness). Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Arugula Pesto can be refrigerated for 4 days or frozen in ice cube trays for up to 6 months. (You won't be sorry if you decide to double the recipe!)
