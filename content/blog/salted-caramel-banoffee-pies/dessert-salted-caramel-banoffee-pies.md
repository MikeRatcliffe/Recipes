## description

We love serving this dessert for dinner parties, but we have to admit to throwing it together for a weeknight treat, too.

## ingredients

- 10 g butter
- 8 Biscoff biscuits (or other caramelized biscuits)
- 110 g cream cheese
- 175 g Greek-style yoghurt
- 3 tsp granulated sugar
- 2 tsp salted caramel flavouring
- bananas
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp salted caramel sauce

## steps

### Biscuit Base

1. Melt the spread in a bowl in the microwave for around 10 seconds.
2. Crush the Lotus Biscoff biscuits into fine crumbs in a bowl. Pour over the melted spread and mix to combine fully.
3. Divide the biscuit mixture among four ramekins and press it down firmly into each dish. Pop the ramekins in the fridge for 10 minutes to allow the biscuit base to firm up.

### Banoffee Cream

1. Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese, Greek yoghurt, sweetener and salted caramel flavouring in a bowl until smooth.
2. Place in the fridge until the pies are ready to assemble.

### Assembly

1. Peel and cut the bananas into thin slices. Place them in a bowl and coat them with the lemon juice - this will stop the banana from discolouring.
2. Remove the ramekins from the fridge and add a layer of banana slices on top of the biscuit base. Spoon the chilled cheesecake mix on top of the banana layer, then finish with another layer of banana slices.
3. Drizzle over the salted caramel sauce and serve.
