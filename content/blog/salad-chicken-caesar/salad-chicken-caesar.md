## ingredients

### Marinade

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 4 chicken breasts (boneless)

### Dressing

- 1 cup plain greek yogurt
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 28 g anchovy fillets (minced optional)
- 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

### Salad

- 4 hard-boiled eggs (quartered)
- 1 large romaine or cos lettuce (chopped)
- 2 medium avocados (diced)
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (grated)
- 2 tbsp chopped chives (to garnish)

## steps

### Marinade

1. Whisk olive oil, oregano, and salt in a small mixing bowl.
2. Place the chicken breast into a ziplock bag, add the marinade, and seal the bag.
3. Gently press the marinade around the chicken to coat evenly. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight if time allows)

### Dressing

1. Mix all the dressing ingredients to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

### Cook The Chicken

1. When ready to cook the chicken take it out of the fridge and let it sit for 15 minutes to allow it to get to room temp.
2. Fry the marinated chicken for 6-8 minutes without moving. Avoid pressing and prodding.
3. Flip the chicken and cook on the second side until golden brown, about 4-6 minutes.
4. Remove from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Allow to sit for a few minutes, then slice and set aside.

### Salad

1. Boil the eggs. Chop the lettuce into large pieces and slice the avocado into chunks.
2. Peel and slice the eggs into quarters, set aside.

### Assembling

1. Place the chopped lettuce and avocado in a large salad bowl. Add eggs and sliced chicken.
2. Drizzle the prepared dressing all over the chicken. Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese and top with chives.
3. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper, if needed.
