This Joe's Special Scramble recipe is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner because it's simple, inexpensive and delicious! This classic scramble with spinach, mushrooms, and ground beef is something you can whip up on a moment's notice!

## ingredients

- 10 large eggs
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 28 g butter
- 1 small onion (finely chopped)
- 225 g mushrooms (trimmed and thinly sliced)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 225 g minced beef
- 140 g baby spinach

## steps

1. Heat a 12" cast-iron or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. While the pan is heating up, crack the eggs in a medium bowl.
2. Whisk the eggs with the water, 1 tsp fish sauce, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Set aside.
3. When the frying pan is nice and hot, add the ghee. Once it's shimmering, toss in the onions and mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp salt.
4. Cook, uncovered, until mushrooms release their liquid.
5. Stir-fry for another 5 minutes, or until the mushroom liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are browned.
6. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
7. Toss the minced beef in the pan and use a spatula to break up the meat.
8. Add 1/2 tsp salt and cook until the meat is no longer pink.
9. Add the spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is just wilted. Taste the filling to check that it's seasoned enough and adjust if needed.
10. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Stir and scrape the pan 'til the eggs are fully set, about 3 to 5 minutes.
