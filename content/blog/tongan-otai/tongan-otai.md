## description

A refreshing watermelon coconut drink from Tonga.

## ingredients

- 750 g cold watermelon (cubed)
- 210 g cold pineapple (crushed)
- 400 ml cold full fat coconut milk
- 240 ml cold coconut water
- 2 tbsp lime juice

## steps

1. Add all the ingredients except to a blender ad pulse until blended but still chunky - you don’t want a thin puree.
2. Chill for about 30 min then serve over ice.

## notes

- Chill the whole watermelon then cut and scoop out the flesh right before making the drink.
- Shake the can of coconut well before chilling so the cream layer doesn’t stick to the top and shake again well before opening.
