## description

This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together.

## ingredients

- 1 large onion (diced)
- 1 red pepper (chopped)
- 2 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 500g lean minced beef
- 1 beef stock cube
- 400 g can chopped tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp dried marjoram
- 1 tsp sugar (or thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate)
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 410g can red kidney beans
- plain boiled long grain rice (to serve)
- soured cream (to serve)

## steps

### The Veg

1. Cook the oil and onion until the onion is slightly translucent.
2. Tip in the garlic, red pepper, chilli powder, paprika and cumin.
3. Stir, then leave to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### The Sauce

1. Brown 500g lean minced beef.
2. Crumble stock cube into 300 ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.
3. Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in marjoram, sugar and a good shake of salt and pepper. 
4. Add tomato purée and stir well.
5. Put a lid on the pan and simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. If the sauce sticks to the bottom of the pan, add a couple of spoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.
7. Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.
8. Taste a bit of the chilli and season as required.
9. Replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave to stand for 10 minutes.
10. Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.
