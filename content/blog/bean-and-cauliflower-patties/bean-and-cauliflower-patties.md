## ingredients

- 200g cauliflower (steamed)
- 40g edamame beans
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 tsp mixed dried herbs
- 200g turnips (cut into chip sized chunks)

## steps

1. Steam the cauliflower and edamame beans until soft. Mash together and season with chilli flakes and dried herbs. Place in a pan on a gentle heat to evaporate as much water as possible.
2. Scoop the mixture into chef rings or small ramekins or just mould into patties by hand. Freeze and store any extra patties for another day.
3. Peel the turnip and cut into chips. Place in a freezer bag and season with cayenne pepper and paprika. Toss to coat.
