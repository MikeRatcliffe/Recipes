## ingredients

- 1 medium aubergine
- 200g white mushrooms (diced)
- 1 garlic cloves (sliced)
- 1 large tomato
- 1 small onion
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- Pinch nutmeg
- Handful chopped fresh parsley

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
2. Cut a groove down the centre of the aubergine, lengthwise. Season and place in the oven for about 15-20 minutes until soft. Scoop out the centre and set aside.
3. In a non-stick pan, dry fry the mushrooms, until browned. Add the onion and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes. Then add the tomatoes and spices. Simmer over a gentle heat for 10 minutes.
4. Stuff the aubergine with the mixture and bake for 10-12 minutes. Top with fresh parsley and serve with the salad.
