## description

Japanese Gyudon, thinly sliced fatty beef cooked in a slightly sweet mixture of mirin and soy sauce served over rice. Topped with an egg, Gyudon is the best!

## ingredients

- Nut oil
- 2 medium onions (thinly sliced half rings)
- 450 g very thinly sliced beef (marbled)
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp rice wine
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 4 cups cooked white rice
- 1 spring onion (chopped)

## steps

1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large frying pad over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.
2. Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned.
3. Add the rice wine, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.
4. When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among 4 bowls, and top with the beef.
5. Garnish with chopped spring onion.
