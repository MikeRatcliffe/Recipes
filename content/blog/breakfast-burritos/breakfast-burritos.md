## description

Filled with sausage, eggs, cheese and fresh avocado salsa, these bodega-style breakfast burritos are delish any time of day!

## ingredients

### Avocado-Tomato Salsa

- 1 large avocado (diced)
- 1-2 tomatoes (diced)
- 1 shallot (minced)
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 1 jalape√±o pepper (minced)
- 1 tbsp fresh lime juice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 10 g fresh chopped coriander

### Burritos

- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 225 g spicy sausage such as Chorizo (removed from casings)
- 170 g shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 flour tortillas
- Vegetable oil

## steps

### Avocado-Tomato Salsa

1. Place all of the ingredients in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Set aside.

### Burritos

1. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the smoked paprika and salt. Set aside.
2. Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage from the pan to a plate, leaving the drippings in the pan. Reduce the heat to low.
4. Add the eggs and scramble until just cooked through. Transfer the eggs to a plate. Clean the pan (you'll use it again).

### Assemble the burritos

1. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the avocado-salsa onto each tortilla, followed by a quarter of the sausage, a quarter of the eggs, and 1/3 cup cheese.
2. Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling and roll, tucking in the edges as you go.
3. Lightly coat the pan with oil and set over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the burritos, seam side down.
4. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the burritos over and continue cooking, covered, until golden, a few minutes more. Serve warm.

## notes

### Make Ahead

The burritos may be assembled a few hours ahead of time, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated, before cooking. To reheat leftover burritos, wrap in foil and warm in a 180C oven for about 15 minutes.
