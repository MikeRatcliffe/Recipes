## description

These roasted sweet potatoes have a crispy caramelized exterior and a soft irresistible interior.

## ingredients

- 1 kg sweet potatoes (cut into 2.5 cm slices)

- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder

## steps

1. Heat the oven to 200C.
2. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt, then stir them with your hands until coated.
3. Add the cumin and chili powder and toss to coat. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer.
4. Roast the potatoes. Roast for 15 minutes. Use a thin spatula flip the potatoes, and if using, add the honey and toss to coat. Roast until the potatoes are tender and browned all over, 15 to 20 minutes more.
