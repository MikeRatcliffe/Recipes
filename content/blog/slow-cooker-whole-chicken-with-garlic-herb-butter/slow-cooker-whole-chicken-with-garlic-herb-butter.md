## description

This slow cooked whole chicken recipe is easy to make and turns out juicy every time! Just 15 minutes to prep.

## ingredients

- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary (divided)
- 100 g butter (softened)
- 1 head garlic (4 cloves minced, remaining ones peeled and whole)
- 2 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 5-lb whole chicken

## steps

### Prepare

1. Chop the leaves from half the rosemary finely (set the remaining whole sprigs aside).
2. In a small bowl, mash together the butter, 4 cloves minced garlic, chopped rosemary, salt, paprika, and pepper. Set aside.
3. Use paper towels to pat the chicken VERY dry inside and out.
4. Starting from the cavity side of the chicken, gently insert your hands underneath the skin to separate the skin from the meat, including the breast, thighs and legs.
5. Use your hands to rub half the garlic herb butter all over underneath the skin. Rub the remaining butter all over the top and sides of the chicken.
6. Stuff the remaining 2 whole rosemary sprigs inside the chicken cavity.
7. Place the whole chicken, breast side up, on a trivet in the slow cooker.

### Cook

1. Slow cook for 4-5 hours on high.
2. Lift the lid about an hour into cooking and use a pastry brush or baster to spread the herb butter more evenly over the top and sides of the chicken.
3. After slow cooking, preheat the oven at 220C and bake the chicken for 20 minutes.
4. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes on a plate before carving.
5. Enjoy!
