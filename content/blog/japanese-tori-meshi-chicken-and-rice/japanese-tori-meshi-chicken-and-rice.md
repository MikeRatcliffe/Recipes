## description

Tori Meshi (鶏飯) literally means "chicken rice" in Japanese. It’s a home-style, comforting Japanese dish where rice is cooked together with chicken and lightly seasoned, so the flavor of the chicken infuses the rice.

## ingredients

- 720 g rice
- 450 g boneless chicken thigh or breast (diced small)
- 120 g carrot (finely diced)
- 100 g shiitake mushrooms (diced)
- 750 ml chicken stock
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp sake
- 2 tbsp mirin (or 25 g sugar if no mirin)
- 1/2 tsp salt

## steps

1. Rinse 720 g rice until water runs mostly clear. Drain well.
2. Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Dice carrot and mushrooms.
3. Put rice in the rice cooker bowl (or a large pot).
4. Add chicken, carrot, and mushrooms.
5. Pour in chicken stock, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and salt. Stir gently.
6. Adjust liquid so total equals the normal water level for 720 g (4 cups) rice, about 1,080 ml total liquid.
7. Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes then natural release for 10 minutes.
