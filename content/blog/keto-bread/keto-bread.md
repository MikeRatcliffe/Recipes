## description

Maria Emmerich's viral bread sports a nice crust with a soft, moist center. It's bread — you know what to do. Savor it warm, straight out of the oven, or freeze, defrost, and toast to perfection. Why not top it off with cream cheese and deli turkey for a tasty higher-satiety breakfast, or smear it with butter, and you're in keto heaven.

## ingredients

- 50 g psyllium husk powder
- 140 g almond flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 240 ml water
- 2 tsp cider vinegar
- 3 egg whites

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 175C.
2. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Bring the water to a boil.
3. Add vinegar and egg whites to the dry ingredients, and combine well. Add boiling water, while beating with a hand mixer for about 30 seconds. Don't over mix the dough, the consistency should resemble Play-Doh.
4. Moisten hands with a little olive oil and shape dough into 6 separate rolls. Place on a greased baking sheet. Top with optional sesame seeds.
5. Bake on lower rack in the oven for 50–60 minutes, depending on the size of your bread rolls. They're done when you hear a hollow sound when tapping the bottom of the bun.
