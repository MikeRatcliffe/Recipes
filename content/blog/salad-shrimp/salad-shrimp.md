## description

Shrimp salad is perfectly classic, but some might (wrongly) think it's old school. Ours is far from the gloppy mayo-laden dish from the 80s. We brightened it with red onion, celery, fresh dill and a light mayo dressing with Dijon and lemon zest for zing.

## ingredients

### Salad

- 450 g shrimp (peeled and deveined)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt
- Freshly black pepper
- 1/4 red onion (finely chopped)
- 1 stalk celery (finely chopped)
- 2 tbsp dill (chopped)
- Romaine lettuce (for serving)

### Dressing

- 115 g mayonnaise
- Juice and zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 200C.
2. On a large baking sheet, toss shrimp with oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. Bake until shrimp are completely opaque, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice and zest, and Dijon. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Add cooked shrimp, red onion, celery, and dill to bowl and toss until combined.
6. Serve over lettuce.
