## description

A low carb healthy vegetarian substitution for rice and makes for a lovely light side dish.

## ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 107 g onion (diced, optional)
- 2 tsp garlic (minced, optional)
- 1 large head cauliflower (chunked)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Remove leaves from cauliflower and cut up into large chunks.
2. Place in food processor (do this in batches if necessary - don't overfill the food processor) and lightly pulse until broken down into rice size pieces. Better to have it a little chunky than soggy.
3. Bring a large pan to medium high heat and enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan.
4. When hot, add onions. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent.
5. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
6. Remove onions and garlic from pan.
7. Add cauliflower, salt, and pepper and cook uncovered for 6-8 minutes. Add a touch of oil if it's starting to dry out. Adjust heat accordingly - look for a brownish crust before stirring.
8. Stir and cook for an additional 6-8 minutes or until desired tenderness.
9. Mix in cooked onions and garlic.
10. Add salt to taste.
