## description

Looking for a quick and hearty keto meal that keeps you satiated for a long time? This cheesy-creamy taco omelet is bursting with flavor. A well-rounded way to start your day, perfect for breakfast or brunch.

## ingredients

### Taco seasoning

- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp paprika powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp chilli flakes
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried or fresh oregano

### Omelette

- 140 g minced beef
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lime (juiced, optional)
- 1 avocado
- 140 g cheddar cheese (grated)
- 1 tomato (diced)
- 1 tsp fresh coriander
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## steps

1. Combine all ingredients for the taco seasoning.
2. Add minced beef to a large non-stick frying pan.
3. Add taco seasoning mix, combine well and fry until fully cooked.
4. Remove from heat and set aside in a bowl.
5. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until fluffy.
6. Lower the heat and add olive oil in the same frying pan. Add the eggs. As the edges are becoming solid, push the edges towards the middle, allowing the uncooked parts to flow to the edge. Cook for a few minutes, keep the insides a bit runny.
7. Squeeze lime on the minced beef. Combine well.
8. Cut avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop out the flesh. Cut into pieces.
9. Distribute minced beef on top of the omelet. Add 2/3 of the grated cheese and chopped tomatoes.
10. Carefully remove the omelet from the frying pan. Fold and top with more cheese, avocado and coriander.
11. Season with salt and pepper.
12. Serve immediately.
