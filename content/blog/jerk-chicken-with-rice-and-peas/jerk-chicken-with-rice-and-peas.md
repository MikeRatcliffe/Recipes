## ingredients

- 4 medium chicken breast fillets​
- A squeeze of lemon or lime juice

## steps

1. In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the rub. ​
2. Add the chicken fillets and massage the rub into the fillets until they are evenly coated.​
3. Allow the chicken to marinate in a covered bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes or overnight. ​
4. Remove from the fridge and allow to stand for 15–30 minutes before cooking. ​
5. Whilst the chicken marinates, add the coconut milk and 100ml of water into a deep saucepan, bring to the boil and add the basmati rice. Turn the heat down and cover with a lid. Allow to simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the rice is cooked. ​
6. When the rice is almost ready (approx. 5 minutes left), stir the kidney beans though the rice and continue to cook until all the liquid is absorbed. ​
7. Season the rice and peas with the spring onions and add black pepper to taste.​
8. Cook the fillets on a hot BBQ or in a pre-heated non-stick griddle pan, turning to allow all sides to brown evenly, about 4–5 minutes on each side. ​
9. Ensure that the chicken is cooked through by cutting into the thickest part of each fillet and making sure it is no longer pink and slightly translucent. ​
10. When the chicken is fully cooked, remove from the heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes. ​
11. Stir the kidney beans into the rice and cook while the chicken rests.​
12. Slice the chicken and serve it with your rice and peas and a squeeze of lemon or lime.
