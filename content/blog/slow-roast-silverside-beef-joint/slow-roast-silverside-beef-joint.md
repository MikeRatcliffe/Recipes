## description

Silverside beef is a great choice for a roast beef dinner. Not only does it have a great flavour, but it's also economical. However, if it isn't cooked correctly, it will be tough and chewy. In this blog post, we will teach you the best way to cook silverside beef in the oven for a delicious and tender roast. Silverside roasting joints should not be served rare or medium, for the most tender slices cooking well done is the best way.

## ingredients

- 1.5 kg Silverside Beef Joint
- Salt and Pepper
- 1 large onion (cut in quarters)
- 2 carrots (roughly chopped)
- 4 cloves garlic (whole)
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 200 ml red wine (optional)
- 300 ml beef stock (use 500ml stock if not using wine)

### Gravy From Beef Drippings

- 500 ml beef stock
- 2 tbsp cornflour
- 2 tbsp cold Water

2. Remove packaging and use some kitchen paper towel to pat dry.
3. Season with salt and pepper, keep netting on.
4. Preheat the oven to 150째C fan.
5. Cut vegetables into large chunks and place in a baking tray with thyme.
6. Sear all sides of beef in a pan with hot oil until browned, using a large pair of kitchen tongs helps
7. Place the seared beef joint on top of the chopped vegetables
8. Deglaze the pan with red wine for 2 minutes scraping any sediments off the pan to add flavour.
9. Add stock and bring to the boil
10. Pour stock and wine from pan into the roasting tin but NOT over the beef.
11. Cover the whole roasting tin with kitchen foil so that no steam escapes during cooking.
12. Place in the 150째C fan  oven for the following time depending on your joint size.
  - 800 g - 2 hours
  - 1 kg - 2 hour 15 minutes
  - 1.2 kg - 2 hour 30 minutes
  - 1.5 kg - 3 hours
  - 2 kg - 3 hours 30 minutes
13. If you have a thermometer cook until the meat reaches at least 90째C / 195째F

### Resting The Beef

1. Remove beef from the roasting tray and cover with foil.
2. Rest for at least 30 minutes the longer the better, plenty of time to make side dishes, see below to make the gravy.
3. DO NOT slice the roast beef until rested.
4. Serve with all the trimmings and the gravy

### Gravy

1. Sieve the juices from the roasting tray into a pan
2. Use the back of a spoon to squeeze the garlic and vegetable juices and flavours through.
3. Add extra beef stock, put on high heat.
4. Mix cornflour with water in a separate bowl, then slowly pour into beef stock whilst whisking to thicken.
5. Allow to boil, then turn down. Check consistency, use extra cornflour if thicker gravy is desired or add more water to thin out.
6. Pour gravy over the plated roast dinner
