This Pressure Cooker Texas Style Brisket makes juicy beef that tastes amazing.

## ingredients

### Brisket

- 1 kg brisket
- 200 g lard

### Texas BBQ Dry Rub

- 2 1/2 tbsp of sea salt
- 1 tsp chili
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp chili flakes

### Add To Pressure Cooker

- 1 litre beef stock
- 120 g lard
- 2 tbsp black pepper

## steps

### Prepare The Brisket

1. Put the brisket in a ziplock bag.
2. Add the dry rub to the bag and massage it into the meat.
3. Allow at least 1 hour at room temperature to help the seasoning penetrate the meat. Overnight in the refrigerator would be best for the flavors to penetrate the brisket.

### Cooking

1. Sear the seasoned beef brisket on all sides.
2. Add in the brisket and beef stock to the pressure cooker. Add enough to cover the brisket 2/3 of the way up the sides.
3. Next, add the lard and the extra black pepper.
4. Pressure cook on high for 1 hour 15 minutes.
5. Natural release for 15 minutes, then quick release.
