## ingredients

- 3 Courgettes (thinly sliced)
- 1/2 tsp Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Onion powder
- 1/2 tsp Chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp Mustard seeds

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
2. Set aside the courgettes for 20 minutes. Dry the slices with some paper towel to absorb extra moisture (the dryer the courgettes the crispier they will get).
3. Season the courgettes with the onion powder, chilli powder and mustard seeds then bake in the oven for around 2 hours or until they reach your desired consistency.
4. Remove, cool for a few minutes then enjoy!
