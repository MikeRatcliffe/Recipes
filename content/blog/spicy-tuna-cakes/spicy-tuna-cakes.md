## description

These portable spicy tuna cakes filled with sweet potato and jalapeño peppers are delicious, tender and Low Carb!

## ingredients

- 3 tbsp melted ghee (divided)
- 300 g canned tuna packed in water (drained)
- 3 spring onions (thinly sliced)
- 2 tbsp fresh coriander (finely chopped)
- 175 g sweet potato (mashed)
- Zest from 1/2 medium lemon
- 1 tbsp minced jalapeño pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp chillies (crushed)
- Salt
- Black pepper

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 175C, and use a brush to grease a 12-slot regular sized muffin tin with one tbsp of melted ghee.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the tuna, spring onions, and coriander.
3. Add the mashed sweet potato to the tuna mixture, and gently combine.
4. Then, mix in the lemon zest, jalapeño, the remaining two tbsp of ghee, eggs, and crushed chillies. Season with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper to taste.
5. Use your hands to mix everything together because that way you can make sure that the fish chunks aren't overly broken up.
6. Scoop a 60 ml of the mixture into each greased muffin tin slot and flatten with the back of a spoon.
7. Bake the tuna cakes for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out cleanly.
8. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool.

## notes

The easiest way I've found to get the tuna cakes out of the muffin tin is to put the wire rack on top of the muffin tin, flip everything upside-down, and tap them gently on the counter.
