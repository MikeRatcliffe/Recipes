## description

Classic egg salad is usually keto-friendly as it is. But because fat=good, we added an extra creamy, but healthy element: avocado! The whole thing tastes nice and fresh but trust us, it'll really fill you up!

## ingredients

- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp chives (finely chopped)
- Black pepper
- Salt
- 6 hard boiled eggs (peeled and chopped)

- Lettuce (for serving)
- Cooked bacon (for serving)

## steps

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and chives.
2. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Add eggs and avocado and toss gently to combine.
4. Serve with lettuce and bacon.
