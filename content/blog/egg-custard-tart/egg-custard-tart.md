## description

Traditional Egg Custard Tart with a lovely homemade pastry and a very silky smooth filling. Serve warm or chilled. I love mine chilled! You can also make mini ones in a muffin pan if you prefer!

## ingredients

- 170 g Shortcrust pastry
- 3 tbsp regular Sugar
- 4 eggs
- 550 ml milk.
- Sprinkle nutmeg (grated)

## steps

### Pastry

1. Put the oven on to 190C.
2. Make your shortcrust pastry.
3. Grease your flan dish.
4. Roll out the pastry into the shape of your flan dish. Make sure there is enough to reach up the sides of your dish.
5. Use your rolling pin to transfer the pastry to the dish.
6. Gently push the pastry around the sides of the dish. It's easier to lift the pastry a little and then push into the sides.
7. Use a sharp knife and trim the edges to make it tidy.
8. If you spot any holes or bits of pastry missing, use some of your cut-offs to patch up.
9. You need to bake blind for 20 minutes in the oven. 5 minutes before the end of baking blind, remove the weights used and return to the oven.

### Egg Custard Filling

1. Reduce the oven temperature to 180 C.
2. Prepare custard filling by hand whisking eggs in a mixing bowl.
3. Heat milk & sugar in a pan and bring to the boil.
4. Add the milk to the whisked eggs gradually, stirring as you pour, to prevent the eggs from scrambling.
5. Pass the mixture through a sieve and allow to cool for 15 minutes, or immerse the bowl in cold water in the sink to cool the custard down a little.
6. Carefully pour the mixture into the pastry case and sprinkle some nutmeg on the surface.
7. Place in the oven, after 30 minutes, check if it's done. If the surface of the custard 'wobbles' too much when you move the dish, leave for a further 5 minutes.
8. When done, leave to cool before removing it from the flan dish
