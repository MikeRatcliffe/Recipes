## description

This Chicken Tinga recipe calls for chipotle chili powder and canned tomatoes instead of harder-to-find fresh peppers and ripe tomatoes. These kitchen shortcuts make this classic Mexican dish a breeze to makeâ€”without compromising any of the authentic flavors.

## ingredients

- 1 1/2 kg chicken thighs
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- Salt
- 2 tbsp ghee or lard
- 1 small white onion (finely chopped)
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 6 medium garlic cloves (crushed)
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp chilli powder
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tins diced tomatoes (drained)
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 500 ml bone broth

## steps

1. In a large bowl, toss the chicken thighs with pepper and 2 tsp of salt.
2. Melt the fat in a large pot over medium heat. Once the fat is shimmering hot, add the onions, tomato puree, and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook, stirring until the onions have softened.
3. Toss in the garlic, oregano, chilli powder, and bay leaves. Stir for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
4. Add the drained tomatoes and apple cider vinegar, and pour in the broth.
5. Stir well to combine, and then add the chicken. Increase the heat to high, and bring everything to a boil.
6. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the thighs are cooked through.
7. transfer the cooked thighs to a plate and set it aside. Crank the stove up to high and bring the sauce to a boil.
8. While the sauce is cooking, shred the chicken thighs.
9. Once the sauce reduces by half (which takes about 10 minutes) turn off the heat and fish out the bay leaves.
10. With an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper if necessary.
11. Add the chicken back into the pot and stir to combine.
12. Serve the tinga in lettuce wraps or grain-free tortillas.
