## description

Creamy Pressure Cooker Mac And Cheese recipe that is the BEST pressure cooker mac and cheese you'll ever make. Cheesy perfection.

## ingredients

- 500 g macaroni
- 950 ml chicken broth
- 30 g butter
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 250 ml milk
- 500 g cheddar cheese

## steps

1. Turn your pressure cooker on and add the macaroni[^†], chicken broth, salt, and pepper.
2. Pressure cook on high for 3 minutes.
3. Quick release.
4. Add the butter and stir until melted and well combined.
5. Add half of the cheese. Stir until well combined and then do the same with the rest.
6. Add the milk. Stir until well combined.
7. Enjoy!

## notes

[^†]: If you are not using macaroni pasta, follow these instructions to determine the proper pressure cooking time then use the formula `recommended cooking time / 2 - 2`

So, if the box recommends 10 minutes of cook time: `10 / 2 - 2 = 3` so pressure cook for 3 minutes.
