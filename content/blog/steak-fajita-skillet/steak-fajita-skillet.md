## description

This keto-friendly steak fajita frying pan takes minutes to prepare, and it's very healthy for you!

## ingredients

### Rub

- 227 g steak
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 1/8 tsp cumin seed
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp olive oil

### Cooking

- 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 peppers
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 30 g Monterey cheese (grated)

## steps

### Rub

1. Lay the sirloin on a flat surface, and rub it down with the salt, pepper, cumin, paprika and olive oil.

### Cooking

1. Drizzle the olive oil in a frying pan, and cook the steak on high heat for 6-7 minutes per side until it's cooked through and has a golden brown char on the outside. Remove the steak from the frying pan, and set it aside to rest.
2. Slice the pepper into strips. Turn the frying pan heat down to medium-low, and cook the peppers until they're soft and browned with the remaining salt and pepper.
3. Slice the cooked steak into strips. Return them to the frying pan with the peppers, and turn the heat off. Sprinkle the cheese over the ingredients so it melts slightly.
