## ingredients

### Marinade

- 1 kg chicken thighs
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 3 tbsp honey
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger (minced)
- 3 tbsp orange juice (freshly squeezed)
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp lime zest
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 3 tbsp coconut milk
- 1 tbsp arrowroot powder

### Cooking

- 450 g asparagus (tough ends trimmed, spears cut in half)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds (optional)
- 2 tbsp coriander leaves (optional)

## steps

### Marinade

1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and cut into 2-3 cm pieces.
2. Sprinkle salt and black pepper on the chicken and toss well to distribute seasoning.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, orange juice, sesame oil, olive oil, lime zest and juice, coconut milk, and arrowroot powder.
4. Drop in the chicken pieces and toss to coat with the marinade. Marinate the chicken at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.

### Cooking

1. Heat the grill on high and arrange a rack 15cm from the heat source.
2. Lightly grease a sheet pan.
3. Transfer the chicken onto the sheet pan in a single layer on one side of the pan.
4. Place the asparagus on the other side of the pan. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
5. Pour the marinade all over the chicken and asparagus.
6. Pop the tray under the grill and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring at the halfway point. The sheet pan is ready when the chicken is cooked through, the asparagus is nicely browned, and the sauce has thickened slightly.
7. Serve with cauliflower rice.
