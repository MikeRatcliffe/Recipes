Here's a keto friendly version of Sonoran hot dogs, crispy bacon-wrapped hot dogs smothered with your favorite Mexican-inspired toppings!

## ingredients

- 4 bacon slices
- 4 hot dogs
- Salt
- 8 lettuce leaves

### Toppings

- 1 large onion (thinly sliced)
- 1 red bell pepper or other color (thinly sliced)
- Salsa
- 1 avocado (peeled and thinly sliced)

## steps

1. Grab a strip of bacon for each hot dog and wrap one around each hot dog in a single layer, tucking the end pieces so the bacon strips don't unravel.
2. Heat a 30 cm frying pan on medium heat. When it's hot, place the four bacon-wrapped hot dogs in a single layer in the middle of the frying pan.
3. Fry the hot dogs undisturbed until the bacon is browned on one side. Then, flip the hot dogs over and fry until browned on the other side.
4. Add the onions and peppers around the hot dogs on the edges and sprinkle salt on the vegetables.
5. Continue browning the Sonoran hot dogs and stir the peppers and onions to ensure even cooking. The dish is ready when the bacon-wrapped hotdogs are browned on all sides and the peppers and onions are tender and caramelized.
6. Serve the hot dogs and saut√©ed peppers and onions with lettuce leaves so that everyone can top each lettuce-wrapped Sonoran hot dog with salsa and sliced avocado if desired.
