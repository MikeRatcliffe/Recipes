This quick and easy Sheet Pan Tandoori Chicken is a delicious Indian inspired keto friendly meal the whole family will love!

## ingredients

### Tandoori Marinade

- 226 g coconut milk
- 2 tbsp tandoori spice mix
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

### Sheet Pan Tandoori Chicken

- 14 g butter (melted)
- 1 small cauliflower 1 kg or less (cut into florets)
- 1 small red onion (cut into thin wedges)
- 680 g chicken thighs (boneless and skinless)
- 4 g coriander (chopped, optional)
- 1 lemon (cut into wedges, optional)

## steps

### Marinade

1. Heat oven to 200C with the rack in the middle.
2. Whisk together the coconut milk, tandoori spice, salt, and lemon juice.
3. Use a pastry brush to evenly spread the butter over the bottom of a rimmed baking sheet.
4. Place the cauliflower and onions in a large bowl and pour in half of the tandoori marinade. Toss well to coat.
5. Shake off the excess marinade and arrange the cauliflower and onions on the greased baking sheet.
6. Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and pour in the remaining marinade. Toss well to coat evenly.

### Cooking

1. Arrange the thighs in a single layer on the sheet pan with the cauliflower.
2. Pop the sheet pan dinner in the oven and roast for 25 to 35 minutes, flipping the cauliflower and rotating the tray 180Â° at the halfway point.
3. The sheet pan dinner is done when the cauliflower is tender and browned and the chicken is cooked through (a meat thermometer should read 74C in the thickest part of the thigh).
4. Enjoy!

## notes

- You can store the leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days and in the freezer for up to 4 months.
- You can experiment with different vegetable combinations. I love using Brussels sprouts and broccoli in this dish!
