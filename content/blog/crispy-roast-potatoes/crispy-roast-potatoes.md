## description

Follow this recipe step by step and get perfect roast potatoes for dinner, for Christmas...all the time!

## ingredients

- 1 kg floury potatoes (such as Maris Piper)
- 120 g duck fat (melted)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 220C.
2. Peel the potatoes and chop into pieces about the size of a ping pong ball.
3. Place in a pan and cover with cold, salty water.
4. Place on the hob on a high heat and bring to the boil for 7 minutes until softened at the edges.
5. Drain the potatoes in a colander, add salt and give them a good shake to really roughen up the edges. Don't worry if a few break apart and they look overly fluffy. The more fluffy they are, the better they'll absorb the fat and the crispier they'll be.
6. Leave the potatoes to steam dry for 10 minutes.
7. Put the potatoes back in the pan and add the melted duck fat.
8. Add to a roasting tin and cook for 50 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.
