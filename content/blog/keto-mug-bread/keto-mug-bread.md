## description

Freshly baked bread in 5 minutes? You've gotta be joking... here's a piece of good news: it's true and it's crispy and low carb, just how it's supposed to be. This recipe has been circulating the internet for a while now and became an instant low carb classic. Find out what all the fuss is about!

## ingredients

- 14 g butter
- 1 tbsp almond flour
- 1 tbsp coconut flour
- 3/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp poppy seeds
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream

## steps

1. Add the butter in the mug and microwave.
2. Mix together all dry ingredients in a bowl. Crack in the egg, add the melted butter, and stir in the cream. Combine until smooth and make sure there are no lumps.
3. Pour the batter into the mug and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Check if the bread is done in the middle – if not, microwave for another 15-30 seconds.
4. Let cool and remove from the mug. Slice in half and toast — that's how you get the best texture and taste.
