## description

This beef jerky recipe is full of awesome savory flavors, it is sugar free, and is irresistibly delicious!

## ingredients

- 1 kg of lean beef
- 120 ml soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper

## steps

### Marinate

1. In a bowl, place a large resealable plastic bag so that it is open at the top.
2. Add all ingredients to the plastic bag.
3. Massage the outside of the bag to work the marinade over all parts of the beef, then place the bag in the fridge for 8 hours or more to marinate.
4. After marinating, pour the meat into a colander in the sink. Push the beef around to allow excess marinade to drain.

### Dehydrate

1. Arrange the beef slices flat in your dehydrator. Make sure none of the slices are touching one another.
2. Dehydrate at 75C for just 10 minutes to kill any bacteria.
3. Dehydrate at 65C for 3 1/2 hours.
4. When dehydrating is complete, leave to cool.
5. Move the jerky into an airtight container.
