## description

The vast majority of packaged pork scratchings will contain a whole heap of additives and sweeteners we avoid. So, the best way to enjoy some pork scratchings is to make it yourself!

## ingredients

- Pig skin
- Salt

## steps

1. Using a sharp knife or kitchen scissors, cut the pig skin into 10-15cm long strips (about 1.5cm wide).
2. Add the strips to a large pan of boiling water - cook for about 5-10 minutes, or until the skin goes translucent.
3. Strain the pig skin and leave them to rest in the colander to allow any excess liquid to drain away.
4. Return the pig skin to the (now dry) pan, sprinkle with salt and stir.
5. Air fry on 200C for 20 minutes until golden and crispy.
6. Enjoy!
