## description

This keto friendly sheet pan pork chop supper combines my favorite cold weather ingredients: pork chops, sage, apples, Brussels sprouts, sweet red onions, olive oil, lemon juice, and aged balsamic vinegar. Plus, it's a breeze to cleanup!

## ingredients

- 5 tbsp olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp fresh sage (chopped)
- 4 garlic cloves (minced)
- Salt
- 4 bone-in pork chops
- 500 g Brussels sprouts (halved or quartered)
- 1/2 large red onion (peeled and cut into 6 wedges)
- Black pepper
- Balsamic vinegar

## steps

1. Set the oven to 220C.
2. In a large bowl, combine 3 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice, sage, garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Mix well.
3. Throw in the pork chops, and coat them well.
4. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and arrange the coated pork chops on the pan. (If you leave off the parchment, the ingredients will brown better BUT clean-up is harder.)
5. Toss the Brussels sprouts, and onion into the bowl with the remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt.
6. Spread the veggies in an even layer around the pork chops. Grind some pepper on top.
7. Make sure everything's in a single layer, and roast for 12 minutes or until the chops are just cooked through (63C in the thickest parts).
8. Crank the heat to broil and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes or until the pork and veggies are browned.
9. Drizzle on some balsamic vinegar. Serve!
