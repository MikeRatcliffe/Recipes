## description

Who doesn't like a cozy brunch with some French toast? We've adapted this popular classic to fit all keto needs. We're not skimping on the butter or cinnamon either. Enjoy!

## ingredients

### Mug bread

- 1 tsp butter
- 2 tbsp almond flour
- 2 tbsp coconut flour
- 11/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp heavy whipping cream

### Batter

- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp heavy whipping cream
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt
- 28 g butter

## steps

1. Grease a large mug or glass dish with a flat bottom with butter.
2. Mix together all dry ingredients in the mug with a fork or spoon. Crack in the egg and stir in the cream. Combine until smooth and make sure there are no lumps.
3. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Check if the bread is done in the middle â€“ if not, microwave for another 15-30 seconds.
4. Let cool and remove from the mug. Slice in half.
5. In a bowl or deep plate, whisk together the eggs, cream and cinnamon with a pinch of salt. Pour over the bread slices and let them get soaked. Turn them around a few times so the bread slices absorb as much of the egg mixture as possible.
6. Fry in plenty of butter and serve immediately.
