## description

From our dreams to reality this low-carb breakfast bake is perfect. We replace the hash browns with riced cauliflower but kept all of the delicious fillings that make this a bake worthy of your brunch crowd.

## ingredients

- 1 large head cauliflower
- 8 slices bacon (chopped)
- 10 large eggs
- 240 ml milk
- 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
- 2 tsp paprika
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 166 g cheddar (grated)
- 2 spring onions (thinly sliced, plus more for garnish)
- Hot sauce, for serving

## steps

1. Preheat oven to 175C.
2. Grate cauliflower and transfer to a large baking tray.
3. In a large frying pan over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, 8 minutes.
4. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain fat.
5. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, garlic, and paprika.
6. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Top cauliflower with cheddar, cooked bacon, and spring onions, and pour over egg mixture.
8. Bake until eggs are set and top is golden, 35 to 40 minutes.
9. Garnish with hot sauce and more spring onions before serving.
