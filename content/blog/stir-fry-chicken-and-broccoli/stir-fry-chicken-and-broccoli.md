## description

Chicken and broccoli stir-fry is a healthy and quick Whole30 meal that you can easily whip up on a busy weeknight! If you aren't cooking simple stir-fries for dinner, you're working too hard!

## ingredients

- 120 ml All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce
- 1 1/2 tsp arrowroot powder (divided)
- 600 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts (cut into bite-size pieces)
- 2 tbsp coconut oil (divided)
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 large shallot (thinly sliced)
- 400 g broccoli (cut into small florets and stems thinly sliced)
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- 2 spring onions (thinly sliced)

## steps

1. Shake up a bottle of All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce if you don't already have one in the fridge.
2. Pour 120 ml of the sauce into a small measuring jug and whisk in 1 tsp of arrowroot powder. Set it aside.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, 1 tbsp coconut oil, fish sauce, salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp arrowroot powder. Mix well to combine.
4. Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 tbsp oil.
5. Add the shallots and cook for 1-2 minutes or until slightly softened.
6. Place the marinated chicken in the pan and fry the meat for 2-3 minutes or until it's mostly cooked through. Transfer the chicken to another platter.
7. Add the broccoli to the empty frying pan and pour in 120 ml of water. Cover the pan and cook the florets until they are bright green and tender-crisp, about 2-3 minutes.
8. Stir in the minced garlic and reserved cooked chicken.
9. Whisk the reserved stir-fry sauce one last time and pour it into the pan. Stir-fry the broccoli and chicken until the sauce simmers and thickens.
10. Transfer the chicken and broccoli stir-fry onto a serving plate and top with sliced spring onions and toasted sesame seeds. Serve with steaming bowls of cauliflower rice!
