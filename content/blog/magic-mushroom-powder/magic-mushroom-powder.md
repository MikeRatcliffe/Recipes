## description

Magic Mushroom Powder is my secret weapon in my kitchen! Sprinkle this umami-packed seasoning salt on anything to make it delicious!

## ingredients

- 85 g dried porcini mushrooms
- 200 g salt
- 3 tbsp crushed chillies
- 2 tbsp dried thyme
- 1 tbsp black pepper

## steps

1. Measure out all your ingredients.
2. Dump your dried mushrooms in the food processor and pulse a few times to chop them up uniformly.
3. Turn the processor on for 2 minutes or as long as it takes for the mushrooms to break down into a fine powder.
4. In a large bowl, combine the powdered mushrooms, salt, crushed chillies, dried thyme, and freshly cracked black pepper. Stir well to mix thoroughly. Once the crushed chillies are evenly distributed, you're all set!
5. Use the greaseproof paper as a funnel to transfer the magic mushroom powder into a jar.
