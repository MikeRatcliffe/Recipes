## description

Shaved Brussels sprouts with bacon is one of the fastest ways to make a deliciously smoky vegetable side dish—and it will knock your socks off, too!

## ingredients

- 4 slices bacon (cut into 1/4" pieces)
- 680 g brussels sprouts (shredded)
- 1 large shallot (thinly sliced)
- 3/4 tsp Magic Mushroom Powder or salt
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp Italian parsley and/or chives (chopped)

## steps

1. Toss the bacon bits into a cold 12" (30cm) frying pan and crank the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon bits are crispy.
2. Check on the bacon. Once it's crispy, use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon bits to a platter.
3. Dump the shallots in the pan with the bacon grease and sauté until they're soft and browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Add the shaved Brussels sprouts and season with the Magic Mushroom Powder or salt. (If you're using Morton's salt or a fine grain salt, only use 3/4 tsp)
5. Stir-fry until the Brussels sprouts are tender, about 5 minutes.
6. Turn off the heat and add the apple cider vinegar. Taste the Brussels sprouts, and adjust the seasoning with additional Magic Mushroom Powder, salt, pepper, or vinegar.
7. Sprinkle on the reserved bacon bits.
