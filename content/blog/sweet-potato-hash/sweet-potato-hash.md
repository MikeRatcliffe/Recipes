## ingredients

- 300g sweet potatoes (diced into bite sized chunks​)
- 10 spring onions (finely sliced​)
- 150g spinach​
- 160g white mushrooms (finely sliced​)
- Paprika ​
- 4 medium eggs​
- 1/2 avocado (diced into bite sized chunks​)
- 1 tsp olive oil​
- Black pepper (to taste​)
- Hot sauce (optional)

## steps

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas mark 7.​
2. Season your sweet potatoes with paprika and spread them out evenly on to the baking tray. Place in the oven and cook for 18 minutes.​
3. In the meantime, add a small amount of oil to a large frying pan over a medium heat and cook your mushrooms until soft. Once soft add your spring onions to the pan for a further 2-3 minutes. Season with black pepper as you go.​
4. Then add your spinach to the pan and cook until the spinach is wilted.​
5. Whilst doing this, cook your eggs. These can be scrambled or poached based on your preference. ​
6. Once the sweet potato is cooked, add this and the avocado to the pan with the rest of the ingredients and gently mix for 1-2 minutes until all ingredients are evenly mixed. ​
7. Serve the ingredients in the pan onto your plate and top with the eggs. If you want more spice, then add your hot sauce onto the top. ​
