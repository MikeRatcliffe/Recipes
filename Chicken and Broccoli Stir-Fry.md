# Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry

## Ingredients

- 120ml All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce
- 1 1/2 teaspoons arrowroot powder divided
- 600g boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-size pieces
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil divided
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large shallot thinly sliced
- 400g broccoli cut into small florets and stems thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 2 scallions thinly sliced

## Method

1. Shake up a bottle of All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce if you don’t already have one in the fridge.
2. Pour 1/2 cup of the sauce into a small measuring cup and whisk in 1 teaspoon of arrowroot powder. Set it aside.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, 1 tablespoon avocado oil, fish sauce, kosher salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot powder. Mix well to combine.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 tablespoon oil.
5. Add the shallots and cook for 1-2 minutes or until slightly softened.
6. Place the marinated chicken in the pan and fry the meat for 2-3 minutes or until it’s mostly cooked through. Transfer the chicken to another platter.
7. Add the broccoli to the empty skillet and pour in 1/4 cup of water. Cover the pan and cook the florets until they are bright green and tender-crisp, about 2-3 minutes.
8. Stir in the minced garlic and reserved cooked chicken.
9. Whisk the reserved stir-fry sauce one last time and pour it into the pan. Stir-fry the broccoli and chicken until the sauce simmers and thickens.
10. Transfer the chicken and broccoli stir-fry onto a serving plate and top with sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds. Serve with steaming bowls of cauliflower rice!
