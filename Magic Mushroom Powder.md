# Magic Mushroom Powder

## Ingredients

- 85 g dried porcini mushrooms
- 1 cup salt
- 3 tablespoons crushed chillies
- 2 tablespoons dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon black pepper

## Method

1. Measure out all your ingredients.
2. Dump your dried mushrooms in the food processor and pulse a few times to chop them up uniformly.
3. Turn the processor on for 2 minutes or as long as it takes for the mushrooms to break down into a fine powder.
4. In a large bowl, combine the powdered mushrooms, salt, crushed chillies, dried thyme, and freshly cracked black pepper. Stir well to mix thoroughly. Once the crushed chillies are evenly distributed, youâ€™re all set!
5. Scoop out a scant 1/3 cup of the Magic Mushroom Powder, and place it on a piece of parchment paper. Pull up the sides of the parchment and use it as a funnel to transfer the seasoning salt into a jar.
