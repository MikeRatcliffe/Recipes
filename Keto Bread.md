# Keto Bread

## Ingredients

- 80 ml (50 g) ground psyllium husk powder
- 300 ml (140 g) almond flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 240 ml water
- 2 tsp cider vinegar
- 3 egg whites

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 175C.
2. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Bring the water to a boil.
3. Add vinegar and egg whites to the dry ingredients, and combine well. Add boiling water, while beating with a hand mixer for about 30 seconds. Don't over mix the dough, the consistency should resemble Play-Doh.
4. Moisten hands with a little olive oil and shape dough into 6 separate rolls. Place on a greased baking sheet. Top with optional sesame seeds.
5. Bake on lower rack in the oven for 50â€“60 minutes, depending on the size of your bread rolls. They're done when you hear a hollow sound when tapping the bottom of the bun.
