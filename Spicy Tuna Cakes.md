# Spicy Tuna Cakes

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons melted ghee divided
- 300 g canned albacore tuna packed in water drained
- 3 scallions thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh coriander
- 175 g mashed baked sweet potato
- finely grated zest from 1/2 medium lemon
- 15 ml crushed jalapeño pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 2.5 ml crushed chillies
- Kosher salt
- black pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 175C, and use a brush to grease a 12-cup regular sized muffin tin with one tablespoon of melted ghee.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the tuna, scallions, and coriander. Add the mashed sweet potato to the tuna mixture, and gently combine.
3. Then, mix in the lemon zest, jalapeño, the remaining two tablespoons of ghee, eggs, and crushed chillies. Season with salt and pepper to taste. I normally use 1 teaspoon salt.
4. Use your hands to mix everything together because that way you can make sure that the fish chunks aren’t overly broken up.
5. Scoop a 1/4 cup of the mixture into each greased muffin tin cup and flatten with the back of a spoon.
6. Bake the tuna cakes for 20-25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out cleanly.
7. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool. The easiest way I’ve found to get them out is to put the wire rack on top of the muffin tin, flip everything upside-down, and tap them gently on the counter.
