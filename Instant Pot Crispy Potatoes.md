# Instant Pot Crispy Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 450 g potatoes peeled and cut into uniform 1 inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons ghee
- Salt
- Black pepper

## Method

1. Add 1/2 cup of water to the cooking insert of an Instant Pot.
2. Dump in the potatoes.
3. Cook in Instant Pot for 5 minutes under high pressure.
4. When the potatoes are done cooking, turn off the Instant Pot and let the pressure release naturally (~10 minutes). Instant Pot users can manually release the pressure at the 10 minute mark if the pressure hasnâ€™t completely dropped by then.
5. You can fry the cooked potatoes right away or refrigerate them in a covered container for up to a week.
6. Melt the ghee or butter over medium high heat in a large skillet. Once it starts sputtering, carefully add the potatoes to the pan.
7. Season generously with salt and pepper.
8. Leave the potatoes undisturbed for 1 minute before flipping to brown the other side for an additional minute.
