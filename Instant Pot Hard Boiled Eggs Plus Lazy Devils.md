# Instant Pot Hard "Boiled" Eggs & Lazy Devils

## Ingredients

- 8 large eggs or the maximum that will fit in a single layer in the steamer insert
- 1 cup (250ml) water
- Optional toppings for Lazy Devils

## Method

1. Pour 1 cup (250ml) of water into your Instant Pot.
2. Place the silicone steamer insert inside and carefully arrange your eggs in a single layer on top.
3. Set the pressure cooker to cook under high pressure for 6 minutes.
4. Fill a big mixing bowl with water and ice cubes.
5. As soon as the eggs are finished cooking, manually release the pressure by turning the vent on top to "Venting."
6. Put the eggs into the ice bath.
7. Chill them in the bath for 5+ minutes.

## Lazy Devils

Simply cut the hard cooked eggs in half, slather on your favorite spread (e.g., mayo, guacamole, tonnato sauce, etc.) and adorn with your favorite toppings.

Here are some of my faves:

- Guacamole + Sliced Radishes
- Mayonnaise + Furikake + Sliced Persian Cucumbers
- Chipotle Lime Mayonnaise + Furikake + Sliced spring onions
- Chipotle Lime Mayonnaise + Prosciutto + Sliced Cucumbers + spring onions
